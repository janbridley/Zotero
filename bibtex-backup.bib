  abstract = {In this study, MIL-53, MIL-96, and amino-MIL-53 were prepared, characterized, and tested for CO2 adsorption. These metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit different characteristics, although MIL-53 and amino-MIL-53 have the same topology. The BET surface areas are 1519, 687, and 262 m2/g for MIL-53, MIL-96, and amino-MIL-53, respectively. They exhibit different thermal stability with MIL-53 having the highest stability which starts to decompose at 773 K, while amino-MIL-53 and MIL-96 show lower thermal stability, decomposing upon heating up to 650 and 570 K, respectively. Static adsorption of CO2 at 1 bar and 273 K was conducted, showing CO2 adsorption capacities of 64, 124, and 48 cc/g for MIL53, MIL-96, and amino-MIL-53, respectively. The heat of adsorption for CO2 was found to be 39, 28.6, and 28 kJ/mol for MIL-53, MIL-96, and amino-MIL-53, respectively. Dynamic adsorption experiment shows that MIL-53 achieves the highest working capacity among all three materials around 169 cc/g at 1 bar and room temperature (304 K). Amino-MIL-53 shows a dynamic adsorption capacity of 121 cc/g at the same conditions and MIL-96 demonstrates a dynamic adsorption of 98.2 cc/g at 1 bar and 298 K. The higher working capacity demonstrated by MIL-53 and amino-MIL-53 are attributed to their larger pore size, making them promising candidate adsorbents for practicing carbon capture in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {The identification of the relative position of two real coplanar ellipses can be reduced to the identification of the nature of the singular conics in the pencil they define and, in general, their location with respect to these singular conics in the pencil. This latter problem reduces to find the relative location of the roots of univariate polynomials. Since it is usually desired that all generated expression are algebraic to simplify further analysis, including the case in which the ellipses undergone temporal variations, all recent methods available in the literature rely mathematical tools such as Sturm-Habicht sequences or subresultant sequences. This paper presents an alternative based on more elementary tools which results in a binary decision tree to classify the relative location of two ellipses in 12 different classes. The decision at each node is taken based on the sign of a set of algebraic/rational expressions on the ellipses coefficients, the most complex of them being third and second order polynomial discriminants.},

This paper presents a simple and unified view of all these construction methods both for unweighted and weighted regular expressions. It describes simpler algorithms with time complexities at least as favorable as that of the best previously known techniques, and provides a concise proof of their correctness. Our algorithms are all based on two standard automata operations: epsilon-removal and minimization. This contrasts with the multitude of complicated and special-purpose techniques previously described in the literature, and makes it straightforward to generalize these algorithms to the weighted case. In particular, we extend the definition and construction of follow automata to the case of weighted regular expressions over a closed semiring and present the first algorithm to compute weighted Antimirov automata.},

Consequently, a wide variety of molecules of medium size with ca. 100 atoms and even more can be analyzed within seconds. Numerical evidence of the algorithm's efficiency is presented for several families of molecules such as helicenes, porphyrins, dendrimers building blocks, fullerene and more.

The structures analyzed include A4B4 inorganic molecules, C8 groups in organic molecules, tetranuclear M4X4 complexes, the coordination sphere of octacoordinated metal atoms, and A4B4 or A8 groups in extended solids. Cu8, Li8 and Na8 clusters, as well as Mn8 and Cu8 supramolecular assemblies are the best examples of that shape in molecular structures. A host of MX2 compounds (M = alkaline-earth element, yttrium, lanthanide or actinide; X = Si, Ge or Ga) crystallize in the ThSi2 structure, in which the M atoms form nearly perfect GBFs; also the high-pressure structures of K, Rb and Cs, provide us with excellent example of the existence of gyrobifastigia in extended solids. The coordination spheres of specific Cd, U, K and Pb complexes have slightly distorted GBF structures which, in the first two cases, are seen to be along the minimal distortion path toward a tetrahedron with four extra weak metal-ligand bonds for U, or toward the hexagonal bipyramid for both Cd and U. The relationship between the GBF shape and the geometry of a C8 fragment found in the diamond structure is studied, and a number of structures are shown to be along the GBF-diamond minimal distortion pathway. {\'O} 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We employ BVH trees instead of cell lists on the CPU for fast performance, especially with large particle size disparity, and optimize inner loops with SIMD vector intrinsics on the CPU. Our GPU kernel proposes many trial moves in parallel on a checkerboard and uses a blocklevel queue to redistribute work among threads and avoid divergence. HPMC supports a wide variety of shape classes, including spheres/disks, unions of spheres, convex polygons, convex spheropolygons, concave polygons, ellipsoids/ellipses, convex polyhedra, convex spheropolyhedra, spheres cut by planes, and concave polyhedra. NVT and NPT ensembles can be run in 2D or 3D triclinic boxes. Additional integration schemes permit Frenkel--Ladd free energy computations and implicit depletant simulations. In a benchmark system of a fluid of 4096 pentagons, HPMC performs 10 million sweeps in 10 min on 96 CPU cores on XSEDE Comet. The same simulation would take 7.6 h in serial. HPMC also scales to large system sizes, and the same benchmark with 16.8 million particles runs in 1.4 h on 2048 GPUs on OLCF Titan.},

This embedding depends on understanding the boundary polytopes of the Niggli-reduced cone                                N                              in the six-dimensional space                                G                              6               .

Combinations of boundary polytopes without a valid intersection in the closure of the Niggli cone or with an intersection that would force a cell edge to zero or without neighboring probe points are eliminated.

  abstract = {In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions -- an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.},

Density functional theory (DFT) is often used to evaluate thermodynamic stability, but quasicrystals are long-range aperiodic and their energies cannot be calculated using conventional ab initio methods. Here, we perform first-principles calculations on quasicrystal nanoparticles of increasing sizes, from which we can directly extrapolate their bulk and surface energies. Using this technique, we determine with high confidence that the icosahedral quasicrystals ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7 are ground-state phases---revealing that translational symmetry is not a necessary condition for the T = 0 K stability of inorganic solids. Although we find the ScZn7.33 quasicrystal to be thermodynamically stable, we show on a mixed thermodynamic and kinetic phase diagram that its solidification from the melt is nucleation-limited, which illustrates why even stable materials may be kinetically challenging to grow. Our techniques here broadly open the door to firstprinciples investigations into the structure-bonding-stability relationships of aperiodic materials.},

In most modelling, the intraplate stresses are typically established on applying plate-driving forces to a homogeneous elastic plate. However, a tectonic plate comprises continental and oceanic lithosphere with sedimentary basins, cratons, and fold belts with varying significant differences in elastic properties, which likely affect the magnitude and pattern of stress and deformation. In the present study, the finite element method (FEM)-based software packages ABAQUS is used to simulate the intraplate stress distribution in the plate using a 3D mechanical model incorporating the elastic properties of the 19 geological regions of the Indian subcontinent and oceanic region. FEM models are validated with Indian plate fixed GPS velocities and found to be in reasonable agreement with the plate's velocity. This study can augment the interpretability of seismic and geological studies. Also, the model can be helpful to perform seismic hazard assessment (using the stress estimated with the FEM model), identify the seismically active zones and collect insight on active intraplate deformation of seismically active regions of the Indian plate by interpreting the strain rate, deformation rate and stress distribution data.},

In the case of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), we show how it arises naturally out of analysis of circulant matrices. In particular, the DFT can be derived as the change of basis that simultaneously diagonalizes all circulant matrices. In this way, the DFT arises naturally from a linear algebra question about a set of matrices. Rather than thinking of the DFT as a signal transform, it is more natural to think of it as a single change of basis that renders an entire set of mutually-commuting matrices into simple, diagonal forms. The DFT can then be ``discovered'' by solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector problem for a special element in that set. A brief outline is given of how this line of thinking can be generalized to families of linear operators, leading to the discovery of the other common Fourier-type transforms.},

Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.},

The phase behavior is mapped out as a function of the aspect ratio (L/D) of the particles, from the hard disc limit at one extreme (L/D=0) to the thin hard needle limit at the other (L/D={$\infty$}). For long rods, a 2D nematic phase is observed at high density in which the orientational correlation functions decay algebraically, indicating that the phase does not possess true long range orientational order. The simulation data indicate that the transition from this phase to the low density isotropic phase is continuous, via a Kosterlitz--Thouless disclination unbinding type mechanism, rather than first order. For short rods the nematic phase disappears so that, on expansion, the solid phase undergoes a first order transition directly to an isotropic phase. Although the latter phase is globally isotropic, we find evidence for strong local positional and orientational correlations between the particles. Where possible, the simulation results are compared and contrasted to experimental, simulation and theoretical data for other two-dimensional liquid crystalline systems.},

In order to fully fill space, only certain rotational symmetries are allowed. Quasicrystals contain aperiodic tilings of two or more basic shapes that allow these forbidden rotation symmetries. A number of quasicrystalline materials have been synthesized in the lab, including a number of aluminum alloys.                                Bindi                 et al.

A number of quasicrystalline grains with composition similar to synthetically formed materials were observed. Thus, quasicrystals can form in nature under geological conditions.                        ,              A sample of the mineral khatyrkite contains quasicrystals, which are ordered but lack the translational symmetry of crystals.           ,              Quasicrystals are solids whose atomic arrangements have symmetries that are forbidden for periodic crystals, including configurations with fivefold symmetry. All examples identified to date have been synthesized in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Here we present evidence of a naturally occurring icosahedral quasicrystal that includes six distinct fivefold symmetry axes. The mineral, an alloy of aluminum, copper, and iron, occurs as micrometer-sized grains associated with crystalline khatyrkite and cupalite in samples reported to have come from the Koryak Mountains in Russia. The results suggest that quasicrystals can form and remain stable under geologic conditions, although there remain open questions as to how this mineral formed naturally.},

These nanomaterials are core-shell nanoalloys with a Cu, Ni, or Co core and a chiral Ag or Au shell of monatomic thickness. The chiral shell is obtained by a transformation of an antiMackay icosahedral shell by a concerted rotation of triangular atomic islands which breaks all mirror symmetries. This transformation becomes energetically favorable as the cluster size increases. Other chiral nanoalloys, belonging to a different structural family of C5 group symmetry, are found in the size range between 100 and 200 atoms. High-symmetry chiral nanoalloys associate strong energetic stability with potential for applications in optics, catalysis, and magnetism.},

It is proved that any parallelohedron               P               as well as tiling by               P               , except the rhombic dodecahedron, can be embedded into the 3D               pcu               net. It is proved that for the rhombic dodecahedron embedding into the 3D               pcu               net does not exist; however, embedding into the 4D               pcu               net exists. The question of how many ways the embedding of a parallelohedron can be constructed is answered. For each parallelohedron, the deterministic finite automaton is developed which models the growth of the crystalline structure with the same combinatorial type as the given parallelohedron.}

For practical purposes the linear symmetry group is the most important, as its computation can be directly translated into a graph automorphism problem. We indicate how to compute integral subgroups of the linear symmetry group that are used, for instance, in integer linear programming.},

By analysing symbolically the sign of the real roots of the characteristic polynomial of the pencil defined by two ellipses/ellipsoids A and B given by X T AX = 0 and X T BX = 0, we derive new formulae characterising when A and B overlap, are separate, or touch each other externally. This characterisation is defined by a minimal set of polynomial inequalities depending only on the entries of A and B so that we need only compute the characteristic polynomial of the pencil defined by A and B, det(TA + B), and not the intersection points between them. Compared with the best available approach dealing with this problem, the new formulae involve a smaller set of polynomials and less sign conditions. As an application, this characterisation provides also a new approach for exact collision detection of two moving ellipses or ellipsoids since the analysis of the univariate polynomials (depending on the time) in the previously mentioned formulae provides the collision events between them.},

Descriptions such as ``the tetrahedral carbon atom'' or ``octahedral coordination complexes'' are widely used as much in elementary textbooks as in the most up-to-date research articles. The definition of molecular shape is, however, not as simple as it might seem at first sight. Molecules don't behave as macroscopic objects do, and the arrangement of atoms within a molecule changes continuously due to the incessant motion of its constituent particles, nuclei, and electrons. How are molecular shape and symmetry affected by this thermal motion? In this Minireview, we introduce the language of continuous symmetry measures as a new tool to quantitatively describe the effects of temperature on molecular shape and symmetry, enriching in this way the set of molecular descriptors that might be used in the establishment of new empirical structure--property relations, of great interest in concomitant areas such as medicinal chemistry or materials science.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The stereochemistries of heptacoordinate transition-metal complexes are analyzed by using continuous symmetry and shape measures of their coordination spheres. The distribution of heptacoordination through the transition-metal series is presented based on structural database searches including organometallic and Werner-type molecular complexes, metalloproteins, and extended solids. The most common polyhedron seems to be the pentagonal bipyramid, while different preferences are found for specific families of compounds, as in the complexes with three or four carbonyl or phosphine ligands, which prefer the capped octahedron or the capped trigonal prism rather than the pentagonal bipyramid. The symmetry maps for heptacoordination are presented and shown to be helpful for detecting stereochemical trends. The maximal symmetry interconversion pathways between the three most common polyhedra are defined in terms of symmetry constants and a large number of experimental structures are seen to fall along those paths.           ,              Les estereoqu{\'i}miques dels complexos de metalls de transici{\'o} heptacoordinats han estat analitzades emprant les mesures cont{\'i}nues de simetria i de forma de llurs esferes de coordinaci{\'o}. Es presenta la distribuci{\'o} de l'heptacoordinaci{\'o} al llarg de les s{\`e}ries de metalls de transici{\'o}, d'acord amb els resultats de cerques de bases de dades estructurals que inclouen complexos moleculars organomet{\`a}llics i de tipus Werner, aix{\'i} com metal{$\cdot$}loprote{\"i}nes i s{\`o}lids estesos.

  abstract = {Equivariance is becoming an increasingly popular design choice to build data efficient neural networks by exploiting prior knowledge about the symmetries of the problem at hand. Euclidean steerable CNNs are one of the most common classes of equivariant networks. While the constraints these architectures need to satisfy are understood, existing approaches are tailored to specific (classes of) groups. No generally applicable method that is practical for implementation has been described so far. In this work, we generalize the Wigner-Eckart theorem proposed in Lang \& Weiler (2020), which characterizes general G-steerable kernel spaces for compact groups G over their homogeneous spaces, to arbitrary G-spaces. This enables us to directly parameterize filters in terms of a band-limited basis on the whole space rather than on G's orbits, but also to easily implement steerable CNNs equivariant to a large number of groups. To demonstrate its generality, we instantiate our method on a variety of isometry groups acting on the Euclidean space R3. Our framework allows us to build E(3) and SE(3)-steerable CNNs like previous works, but also CNNs with arbitrary G {$\leq$} O(3)-steerable kernels. For example, we build 3D CNNs equivariant to the symmetries of platonic solids or choose G = SO(2) when working with 3D data having only azimuthal symmetries. We compare these models on 3D shapes and molecular datasets, observing improved performance by matching the model's symmetries to the ones of the data.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Various classification methods have been developed for geometric form of crystals. One method involves the generation of three-dimensional (3D) models of crystals, mainly through graphical representations. However, traditional graphical representations depend on symmetrical operations of crystal planes and the use of polar stereographic projections. There is still very few geometric analysis or mathematical expression for the rectangular coordinate system, meaning that 3D visualization of crystal forms is limited. In this paper, we present a geometric analysis that allows 3D visualization analysis of crystal forms and identifies geometric relations between crystal forms. We divide crystal models in a 3D rectangular coordinate system within 47 types of geometric form into the tetrahedron, polygon (polyhedron), and cube classes. We determine the vertex space coordinates of the 47 types of crystal form through geometric analysis and coordinate calculation of the crystal forms. Last but not least, in order to obtain 3D models of every geometric form under the automorphism of crystals, it is the convex envelope geometric polyhedron algorithm to be created to calculate the edges and triangular faces by WebGL technology which makes it possible to develop an online interactive 3D crystallographic study system in a web-browser.},

  abstract = {By using theoretical methods and Monte Carlo simulations, this work investigates dense ordered packings and equilibrium phase behavior (from the low-density isotropic fluid regime to the high-density crystalline solid regime) of monodisperse systems of hard convex lens-shaped particles as defined by the volume common to two intersecting congruent spheres. We show that, while the overall similarity of their shape to that of hard oblate ellipsoids is reflected in a qualitatively similar phase diagram, differences are more pronounced in the high-density crystal phase up to the densest-known packings determined here. In contrast to those non-(Bravais)-lattice two-particle basis crystals that are the densest-known packings of hard (oblate) ellipsoids, hard convex lens-shaped particles pack more densely in two types of degenerate crystalline structures: (i) non-(Bravais)-lattice two-particle basis body-centered-orthorhombic-like crystals and (ii) (Bravais) lattice monoclinic crystals. By stacking at will, regularly or irregularly, laminae of these two crystals, infinitely degenerate, generally non-periodic in the stacking direction, dense packings can be constructed that are consistent with recent organizing principles. While deferring the assessment of which of these dense ordered structures is thermodynamically stable in the high-density crystalline solid regime, the degeneracy of their densest-known packings strongly suggests that colloidal convex lens-shaped particles could be better glass formers than colloidal spheres because of the additional rotational degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {Colloidal suspensions of two species have the ability to form binary crystals under certain conditions. The hunt for these functional materials and the countless investigations on their formation process are justified by the plethora of synergetic and collective properties these binary superlattices show. Among the many crystal structures observed over the past decades, the highly exotic colloidal icosahedral AB13 crystal was predicted to be stable in binary hard-sphere mixtures nearly 30 years ago, yet the kinetic pathway of how homogeneous nucleation occurs in this system is still unknown. Here we investigate binary nucleation of the AB13 crystal from a binary fluid phase of nearly hard spheres. We calculate the nucleation barrier and nucleation rate as a function of supersaturation and draw a comparison with nucleation of single-component and other binary crystals. To follow the nucleation process, we employ a neural network to identify the AB13 phase from the binary fluid phase and the competing fcc crystal with single-particle resolution and significant accuracy in the case of bulk phases. We show that AB13 crystal nucleation proceeds via a coassembly process where large spheres and icosahedral small-sphere clusters simultaneously attach to the nucleus. Our results lend strong support for a classical pathway that is well-described by classical nucleation theory, even though the binary fluid phase is highly structured and exhibits local regions of high bond orientational order.},

  abstract = {A new method, of very general applicability and very easily programmed for an electronic computer, is proposed for the numerical integration of functions of many independent variables. This new method renders obsolete, in most applications, the commonly used Monte Carlo procedure and the more recent, original method of Haselgrove. In the new scheme the sample points are distributed systematically rather than at random and the ensemble of points forms a unique, closed, symmetrical pattern, which effectively fills the space of the multidimensional integration. The paper contains an extensive statistical-analytic treatment of the error characteristics of the new method, one that enables advance quantitative estimation of upper limits of error in the integration of various types of functions. For continuous functions with bounded first derivatives, the error is shown ultimately to disappear at least as rapidly as the inverse square of the number of sample points; moreover, for runs of practical length the error limits with the new scheme are smaller---by a factor ranging from 2 to perhaps 104 or more---than those of any previous general procedure. The method employs certain rational constants which govern the arrangement of sample points. Tables of such constants, suitably optimized, which will permit the integration of functions with up to 12 independent variables, are provided along with a discussion of a method by which such constants may be obtained.},

@article{CreationHyperbolicOrnaments,
  title = {Creation of {{Hyperbolic Ornaments}}},
  abstract = {Hyperbolic ornaments are pictures which are invariant under a discrete symmetry group of isometric transformations of the hyperbolic plane. They are the hyperbolic analogue of Euclidean ornaments, including but not limited to those Euclidean ornaments which belong to one of the 17 wallpaper groups. The creation of hyperbolic ornaments has a number of applications. They include artistic goals, communication of mathematical structures and techniques, and experimental research in the hyperbolic plane. Manual creation of hyperbolic ornaments is an arduous task. This work describes two ways in which computers may help with this process. On the one hand, a computer may provide a real-time drawing tool, where any stroke entered by the user will be replicated according to the rules of some previously selected symmetry group. Finding a suitable user interface for the intuitive selection of the symmetry group is a particular challenge in this context. On the other hand, existing Euclidean ornaments can be transported to the hyperbolic plane by changing the orders of their centers of rotation. This requires a deformation of the fundamental domains of the ornament, and one particularly well suited approach uses conformal deformations for this step, approximated using discrete conformality concepts from discrete differential geometry. Both tools need a way to produce high quality renderings of the hyperbolic ornament, dealing with the fact that in general an infinite number of fundamental domains will be visible in the finite model of the hyperbolic plane. To deal with this problem, an approach similar to ray tracing can be used, variations of which are discussed as well.},

Yet, little is known about the thermodynamically stable phases of polyhedrally shaped building blocks, such as faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although hard particles are known to organize due to entropy alone, and some unusual phases are reported in the literature, the role of entropic forces in connection with polyhedral shape is not well understood. Here, we study thermodynamic self-assembly of a family of truncated tetrahedra and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including diamond, {$\beta$}-tin, and high-pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape varies from tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest packings of the truncated tetrahedron family obtained by numerical compression and report a new space-filling polyhedron, which has been overlooked in previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled structures differ from the densest packings. We show that the self-assembled crystal structures can be understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment, which can be generalized as directional entropic forces.},

On the other hand, through the solvation free energy relationship between {$\mu$}ex and the surface free energy {$\gamma$} of hard-sphere fluids at a hard spherical wall, we can obtain precise measurements of {$\mu$}ex for large {$\sigma$}, extending up to infinity (flat wall) [R. L. Davidchack and B. B. Laird, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 174706 (2018)]. Within this approach, the cubic polynomial representation is consistent with the assumptions of morphometric thermodynamics. In this work, we present the measurements of {$\mu$}ex that combine the two methods to obtain high-precision results for the full range of {$\sigma$} values from zero to infinity, which show statistically significant deviations from the cubic polynomial form. We propose an empirical functional form for the {$\mu$}ex dependence on {$\sigma$} and {$\eta$}, which better fits the measurement data while remaining consistent with the analytical limiting behavior at zero and infinite {$\sigma$}.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning methods are nowadays used for many biological prediction problems involving drugs, ligands or polypeptide segments of a protein. In order to build a prediction model a so called training data set of molecules with measured target properties is needed. For many such problems the size of the training data set is limited as measurements have to be performed in a wet lab. Furthermore, the considered problems are often complex, such that it is not clear which molecular descriptors (features) may be suitable to establish a strong correlation with the target property. In many applications all available descriptors are used. This can lead to difficult machine learning problems, when thousands of descriptors are considered and only few (e.g. below hundred) molecules are available for training. Results: The CoEPrA contest provides four data sets, which are typical for biological regression problems (few molecules in the training data set and thousands of descriptors). We applied the same two-step training procedure for all four regression tasks. In the first stage, we used optimized L1 regularization to select the most relevant features. Thus, the initial set of more than 6,000 features was reduced to about 50. In the second stage, we used only the selected features from the preceding stage applying a milder L2 regularization, which generally yielded further improvement of prediction performance. Our linear model employed a soft loss function which minimizes the influence of outliers. Conclusions: The proposed two-step method showed good results on all four CoEPrA regression tasks. Thus, it may be useful for many other biological prediction problems where for training only a small number of molecules are available, which are described by thousands of descriptors.},

  abstract = {Invariance and equivariance to the rotation group have been widely discussed in the 3D deep learning community for pointclouds. Yet most proposed methods either use complex mathematical tools that may limit their accessibility, or are tied to specific input data types and network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuron representations for creating SO(3)-equivariant neural networks for pointcloud processing. Extending neurons from 1D scalars to 3D vectors, our vector neurons enable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing a framework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- including linear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to their simplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them to process geometry inputs in arbitrary poses. Despite its simplicity, our method performs comparably well in accuracy and generalization with other more complex and specialized state-of-the-art methods on classification and segmentation tasks. We also show for the first time a rotation equivariant reconstruction network. Source code is available at https://github.com/FlyingGiraffe/vnn.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The International Active Surveillance study ``Safety of Contraceptives: Role of Estrogens'' (INAS-SCORE) investigated the cardiovascular risks associated with the use of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing dienogest and estradiol valerate (DNG/EV) compared to established COCs in a routine clinical setting. Study Design: Transatlantic, prospective, noninterventional cohort study conducted in the United States and seven European countries with two main exposure groups and one exposure subgroup: new users of DNG/EV and other COC (oCOC), particularly levonorgestrelcontaining COCs (LNG). All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest (OoI) were validated via attending physicians and relevant source documents. Main OoI were serious cardiovascular events (SCE), particularly venous thromboembolic (VTEs) events. Comprehensive followup procedures were implemented. Statistical analyses were based on Cox regression models. Results: A total of 50,203 new COC users were followed up for up to 5.5 years (mean value, 2.1 years). Overall 20.3\% and 79.7\% of these women used DNG/EV and oCOC (including 11.5\% LNG users), respectively. A low loss to follow-up of 3.1\% was achieved. Based on 47 (VTE) and 233 (SCE) events, the primary analysis (European data set) yielded adjusted hazard ratios for DNG/EV vs. oCOC of 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. The upper bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals were 0.98 (VTE) and 0.96 (SCE). The corresponding hazard ratios for DNG/ EV vs. LNG showed similar point estimates but the confidence intervals included unity. Conclusion: DNG/EV is associated with similar or even lower cardiovascular risk compared to oCOC and LNG. Implication Statement: A COC containing DNG and EV is associated with similar or even lower cardiovascular risk compared to COCs containing levonorgestrel or other progestogens. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Significance             What makes an object successful at thermal folding? Protein scientists study how sequence affects the pathways by which chained amino acids fold and the structures into which they fold. Here we investigate the inverse problem: Starting with a 3D object as a polyhedron we ask, which ones, among the many choices of 2D unfoldings, are able to fold most consistently? We find that these ``nets'' follow a universal balance between entropy loss and potential energy gain, allowing us to explain why some of their geometrical attributes (such as compactness) represent a good predictor for the folding propensity of a given shape. Our results can be used to guide the stochastic folding of nanoscale objects into drug-delivery devices and thermally folded robots.           ,                             Low-dimensional objects such as molecular strands, ladders, and sheets have intrinsic features that affect their propensity to fold into 3D objects. Understanding this relationship remains a challenge for de novo design of functional structures. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the refolding of the 24 possible 2D unfoldings (``nets'') of the three simplest Platonic shapes and demonstrate that attributes of a net's topology---net compactness and leaves on the cutting graph---correlate with thermodynamic folding propensity.

Our results provide a general heuristic for the design of 2D objects to stochastically fold into target 3D geometries and suggest a mechanism by which geometry and folding propensity are related above                                                                                               T                                                                 x                                                                                       , where native bonds dominate folding.},

Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry               3               . Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96\,nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.},

  abstract = {An increasing variety of crystal structures has been observed in soft condensed matter over the past two decades, surpassing most expectations for the diversity of arrangements accessible through classical driving forces. Here, we survey the structural breadth of mesoscopic crystals---formed by micellar systems, nanoparticles, colloids, etc.---that have been observed in both soft matter experiments and coarse-grained self-assembly simulations. We review structure types that were found to mimic crystals on the atomic scale, as well as those that do not correspond to known geometries and seem to only occur on the mesoscale. While the number of crystal structure types observed in soft condensed matter still lags behind what is known from hard condensed matter, we hypothesize that the high tunability and diversity of building blocks that can be created on the nano- and microscale will render a structural variety that far exceeds that of atomic compounds, which are inevitably restricted by the ``limitations'' imposed by the periodic table of elements and by the properties of the chemical bond. An infusion of expertise in structural analysis from the field of crystallography into the soft condensed matter community will establish the common language necessary to report, compare, and organize the rapidly accruing structural knowledge gathered from simulations and experiments. The prospect of new materials created in soft matter and new, length-scale-spanning insights into the formation of ordered structures in both hard and soft condensed matter promise exciting new developments in the area of self-assembled mesoscale materials.},

  abstract = {The traditional iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is accurate and fast for rigid point set registration but it is unable to handle affine case. This paper instead introduces a novel generalized ICP algorithm based on lie group for affine registration of m-D point sets. First, with singular value decomposition technique applied, this paper decomposes affine transformation into three special matrices which are then constrained. Then, these matrices are expressed by exponential mappings of lie group and their Taylor approximations at each iterative step of affine ICP algorithm. In this way, affine registration problem is ultimately simplified to a quadratic programming problem. By solving this quadratic problem, the new algorithm converges monotonically to a local minimum from any given initial parameters. Hence, to reach desired minimum, good initial parameters and constraints are required which are successfully estimated by independent component analysis. This new algorithm is independent of shape representation and feature extraction, and thereby it is a general framework for affine registration of m-D point sets. Experimental results demonstrate its robustness and efficiency compared with the traditional ICP algorithm and the state-of-the-art methods.},

Frank--Kasper structures occur in the crystallography of metallic alloys, clathrates, zeolites, and in geometrical optimization. 27 such physical structures are known. In Dutour et ai. (Acta Crystallogr A 66:637--639, 2010) we obtained, by computer enumeration, all 84 such structures with up to 20 cells in a reduced fundamental domain; 13 among them were known physical structures. In the present follow-up study, we managed, by improving the computation, to get all 37 new structures with 21 cells in a reduced fundamental domain. Those structures are described, using six invariants: group, the size of fundamental domain, mean coordination number f , fraction sequence, cell orbits and major skeleton. We found pairs of distinct structures having all six invariants equal. So, we devised a new invariant, zigzag vector, and computed it for all 135 structures known from now; all have this invariant different. New bounds for f and new directions (computational perspectives, number of Kekule structures, space octahedrites, space cubites) are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A simple but approximate algorithm is described for computing second virial coefficients based on equilibrated molecular configurations that may be generated during any Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulation. The algorithm uses simple quadrature based on sampling every binary pair in the configuration and moving their center-center distances from zero to infinity. Comparisons are made in the literature results using more sophisticated sampling and integration for n-alkanes of ethane through n-dodecane. Accuracy is within the error bars determined by block averaging, and temperature effects can be inferred using a single configurational temperature, including perturbative virial coefficients. Predictably, the accuracy is best at the configurational temperature and when the configurational density is lowest. More notably, good accuracy is achieved from configurations at intermediate densities, and the trend at high density conveys valuable insight about conformational changes. The algorithm is simple enough to assign as a homework problem in an introductory molecular modeling course and reinforces the elementary knowledge of pairwise potentials among multisite molecules, numerical integration, and conformational averaging. The result is also quite valuable on its own merits, especially considering thermodynamic integration to compute phase equilibria. Additionally, the incidental data derived from the computation can provide simple but meaningful insights into the nature of multisite interactions, as demonstrated by relating the Mayer averaged potential to an effective Mie potential.

The lack of methods to identify and characterize crystal structures reliably in particle simulation data complicates the comparison of simulation outcomes to experiment and the discovery of new materials. Algorithms are sought that not only classify local structure but also analyze the type and degree of crystallographic order. Here, we develop an algorithm that analyzes point group symmetry directly from particle coordinates. The algorithm operates on functions defined on the surface of the sphere, such as the bond orientational order diagram. Other use cases are the orientation of crystals and adoption as generalized order parameters for detecting the appearance of order as well as following its development.},

While the majority of atoms in the resulting crystals are classified as being FCC, stacking faults are observed and can be traced back to the near-critical nuclei.},

Many attempts have been made to change the conduction band of BiVO4 to satisfy the H2O/H2 potential. In this paper, yttrium is introduced to adjust the energy band structure of BiVO4. A novel BiVO4:YVO4 solid solution with a new dodecahedron shape exposing two facets, \{1 0 1\} and \{1 0 0\}, is successfully prepared. On doping with Y, the crystal system of BiVO4 changes from monoclinic to tetragonal. The improved symmetry of the crystal system makes the (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) of \{1 0 0\} facets entirely identical, resulting in dodecahedron tetragonal BixY1 xVO4. The energy levels of the two facets show slight nonconformity. So the photogenerated electrons and holes can be separated efficiently between the adjacent exposed facets to produce H2 and O2, respectively. Through the study of photocatalytic performance, BixY1 xVO4 with Pt as co-catalyst shows highly efficient photocatalytic activity and can split pure water at the stoichiometric ratio.},

In this paper we examine the crystal nucleation rate of hard spheres using three such numerical techniques: molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and a Bennett--Chandler-type theory where the nucleation barrier is determined using umbrella sampling simulations. The resulting nucleation rates are compared with the experimental rates of Harland and van Megen [Phys. Rev. E 55, 3054 (1997)], Sinn et al. [Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 118, 266 (2001)], Sch{\"a}tzel and Ackerson [Phys. Rev. E 48, 3766 (1993)], and the predicted rates for monodisperse and 5\% polydisperse hard spheres of Auer and Frenkel [Nature 409, 1020 (2001)]. When the rates are examined in units of the long-time diffusion coefficient, we find agreement between all the theoretically predicted nucleation rates, however, the experimental results display a markedly different behavior for low supersaturation. Additionally, we examined the precritical nuclei arising in the molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and umbrella sampling simulations. The structure of the nuclei appears independent of the simulation method, and in all cases, the nuclei contains on average significantly more face-centered-cubic ordered particles than hexagonal-close-packed ordered particles.},

The major source of error is the nature of the extrapolation procedure to the thermodynamic limit. We have also computed the free energy difference between hcp and fcc hard-sphere solids at densities close to melting.

  abstract = {The inverse Henderson problem refers to the determination of the pair potential which specifies the interactions in an ensemble of classical particles in continuous space, given the density and the equilibrium pair correlation function of these particles as data. For a canonical ensemble in a bounded domain it has been observed that this pair potential minimizes a corresponding convex relative entropy functional, and that the Newton iteration for minimizing this functional coincides with the so-called inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) iterative scheme. In this paper we show that in the thermodynamic limit analogous connections exist between the specific relative entropy introduced by Georgii and Zessin and a proper formulation of the IMC iteration in the full space. This provides a rigorous variational framework for the inverse Henderson problem, valid within a large class of pair potentials, including, for example, Lennard-Jones type potentials.},

  abstract = {The huge computational expense of atomistic simulations of protein-protein interactions and the lack of mechanistic detail in heuristic methods motivate the development of colloid-like models for proteins. Patchy particle "minimal" models of anisotropically shaped and functionalized colloids have been highly successful at predicting colloidal assembly. In this dissertation, we focus on the effect of shape and examine the role of entropic forces in various colloidal and biological systems. In the first project, we isolate the effect of shape complementarity in protein dimerization and study the reversible binding processes of fifty protein dimer pairs using hard particle Monte Carlo simulations with depletion interactions. We employ depletants using a generic, implicit depletion model to amplify the magnitude of the entropic forces arising from lock-and-key binding. We find that for a subset (13\%) of dimers, protein shape is sufficient to predict native complexes as equilibrium assemblies. We analyze the importance of competing binding configurations and show how they affect assembly. Finally, we implement a machine learning classifier with support vector machine to identify the cases where shape alone can predict the native protein interface. The classifier achieves a precision of 89\% and a recall of 77\%. In the second project, we explore the limit of shape-based models for higher-order protein assembly, and investigate the assembly pathway of insulin as an example. We report the native insulin assembly pathway can be reproduced in a hierarchical manner with a highly simplified shape-based Monte Carlo simulation model despite the absence of enthalpic interactions. We demonstrate that insulin shape is important for explaining the formation of different insulin associated structures including dimer, hexamer and crystal. We further discuss the observed shape complementarity of insulin interfaces, and show that the formation of different interfaces can be tuned by the strength of the shape affinity. Finally, we demonstrate that the coordination of ion particles provides additional thermodynamic stabilization to the hexameric form of insulin. Lastly, we study how shape anisotropy and particle size affect the structural color behavior of discoidal particles. Using hard particle Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that engineering the size and aspect ratio of the discoids can change the degree of ordering in their assembled structures, thereby leading to tunable structural color responses. The simulated structures and reflection spectra agree well with experimental observations, suggesting the power of shape-based models in capturing the assembly structures and properties. Results from this dissertation give insight into the role of shape in protein assembly, which has not been closely investigated, and provide new shape-based minimal models for understanding colloidal and protein assemblies.},

It becomes evident that the stable clusters may have been concealed by the so-called ion pair concept and activity effects. We show that non-classical nucleation via stable prenucleation clusters is a highly valuable concept for a novel understanding of phenomena observed in bio- and biomimetic mineralization, which however may hardly be rationalized by means of classical nucleation theory. The importance to combine experimental and theoretical studies is emphasized.},

We use digital alchemy to determine eigenshapes for possible target colloidal crystal structures for eight families of polyhedral nanoparticle shapes already synthesized in the laboratory.

In certain systems based on the Kalman filter, this test can be performed by checking whether hyperellipsoids overlap. This test can be applied to detecting failure in the system itself or in the sensors used to determine the system state. To facilitate the practical application of such tests, we describe a simple condition for overlap of two ellipsoids and propose an efficient algorithmic implementation for testing this condition. There are applications in many other areas, such as collision avoidance or computer graphics. Our proposal makes use of Leverriere's algorithm and Sturm's theorem, a result of algebraic geometry. Thus, no approximative methods, such as root finding or minimization are needed. Furthermore, the complexity of the algorithm is fixed for a fixed problem dimension.},

  abstract = {Unifying approaches by amongst others Archimedes, Kepler, Goldberg, Caspar and Klug, Coxeter, and Conway, and extending on a previous formalisation of the concept of local symmetry preserving (lsp) operations, we introduce a formal definition of local operations on plane graphs that preserve orientationpreserving symmetries, but not necessarily orientation-reversing symmetries. This operations include, e.g., the chiral Goldberg and Conway operations as well as all lsp operations. We prove the soundness of our definition as well as introduce an invariant which can be used to systematically construct all such operations. We also show sufficient conditions for an operation to preserve the connectedness of the plane graph to which it is applied.},

The cornerstone of such studies is the role of shape in self-assembly and in inducing complex order. The problem of identifying different types of order that can emerge in such systems can, however, be challenging. Here, we revisit the problem of quantifying orientational order in systems of building blocks with non-trivial rotational symmetries. We first propose a systematic way of constructing orientational coordinates for such symmetric building blocks. We call the arising tensorial coordinates strong orientational coordinates (SOCs) as they fully and exclusively specify the orientation of a symmetric object. We then use SOCs to describe and quantify local and global orientational order, and spatiotemporal orientational correlations in systems of symmetric building blocks. The SOCs and the orientational order parameters developed in this work are not only useful in performing and analyzing computer simulations of symmetric molecules or particles, but can also be utilized for the efficient storage of rotational information in long trajectories of evolving many-body systems.},

Diffusion itself results from a series of individual decisions to begin using the new technology, decisions which are often the result of a comparison of the uncertain benefits of the new invention with the uncertain costs of adopting it. An understanding of the factors affecting this choice is essential both for economists studying the determinants of growth and for the creators and producers of such technologies. Section II of this article discusses the modeling of diffusion and Sections III to V explore the determinants of diffusion and the evidence for their importance.},

  abstract = {Colloidal suspensions have long been studied as a model for atomic and molecular systems, due to the ability to fluorescently label and individually track each particle, yielding particle-resolved structural information. This allows various local order parameters to be probed that are otherwise inaccessible for a comparable molecular system. For phase transitions such as crystallisation, appropriate order parameters which emphasise 6-fold symmetry are a natural choice, but for vitrification the choice of order parameter is less clear cut. Previous work has highlighted the importance of icosahedral local structure as the glass transition is approached. However, counting icosahedra or related motifs is not a continuous order parameter in the same way as, for example, the bond-orientational order parameters Q6 and W6. In this work we investigate the suitability of using pentagonal bipyramid membership, a structure which can be assembled into larger, five-fold symmetric structures, as a finer order parameter to investigate the glass transition. We explore various structural and dynamic properties and show that this new approach produces many of the same findings as simple icosahedral membership, but we also find that large instantaneous displacements are often correlated with significant changes in pentagonal bipyramid membership, and unlike the population of defective icosahedra, the pentagonal bypyramid membership and spindle number do not saturate for any measured volume fraction, but continue to increase.},

Such structures are widely reported for nanoparticles, macromolecules, and peptides, and even in entropy-driven hard particle assembly hierarchical colloidal crystals have been reported. Here we consider the hierarchical self-assembly of a cubic colloidal crystal from congruent hard cube derivatives, and investigate how various ways of slicing and dicing a cube can affect the ability of the pieces to entropically re-assemble the initial colloidal crystal formed from perfect cubes. We present design rules that support heuristics reported for different systems, and present evidence for a previously unreported cubatic phase from 2\,:\,1 rectangular prisms.},

The formulation was fitted to experimental data, both for the second virial coefficient itself and for a quantity related to its first temperature derivative, at temperatures between approximately 310 and 1170 K. The high-temperature extrapolation behavior was guided by results calculated from a high-quality intermolecular pair potential. The new correlation agrees well with the experimental data deemed to be reliable, and at high temperatures is a significant improvement over the best previous formulation.},

  abstract = {Nanostructures of diverse chemical nature are used as biomarkers, therapeutics, catalysts, and structural reinforcements. The decoration with surfactants has a long history and is essential to introduce specific functions. The definition of surfactants in this review is very broad, following its lexical meaning ``surface active agents'', and therefore includes traditional alkyl modifiers, biological ligands, polymers, and other surface active molecules. The review systematically covers covalent and non-covalent interactions of such surfactants with various types of nanomaterials, including metals, oxides, layered materials, and polymers as well as their applications. The major themes are (i) molecular recognition and noncovalent assembly mechanisms of surfactants on the nanoparticle and nanocrystal surfaces, (ii) covalent grafting techniques and multi-step surface modification, (iii) dispersion properties and surface reactions, (iv) the use of surfactants to influence crystal growth, as well as (v) the incorporation of biorecognition and other material-targeting functionality. For the diverse materials classes, similarities and differences in surfactant assembly, function, as well as materials performance in specific applications are described in a comparative way. Major factors that lead to differentiation are the surface energy, surface chemistry and pH sensitivity, as well as the degree of surface regularity and defects in the nanoparticle cores and in the surfactant shell. The review covers a broad range of surface modifications and applications in biological recognition and therapeutics, sensors, nanomaterials for catalysis, energy conversion and storage, the dispersion properties of nanoparticles in structural composites and cement, as well as purification systems and classical detergents. Design principles for surfactants to optimize the performance of specific nanostructures are discussed. The review concludes with challenges and opportunities.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy revealed that metallic silver (Ag) and cobalt (oxy)hydroxide (CoOx(OH)y) particles were selectively deposited onto the \{010\} and \{110\} facets, respectively, regardless of the cocatalyst amount. By contrast, the nickel (oxy)hydroxide (NiOx(OH)y) photodeposition depends on the nickel precursor amount with an unprecedented selectivity for 0.1 wt \% NiOx(OH)y/BiVO4 with a preferential deposition onto the \{010\} facets and the edges between the \{110\} facets. Moreover, these noble metal-free heterostructures led to remarkable photocatalytic properties for rhodamine B photodecomposition and sacrificial water oxidation reactions. For instance, 0.2 wt \% CoOx(OH)y/BiVO4 led to one of the highest oxygen evolution rates, i.e., 1538 {$\mu$}mol h-1 g-1, ever described which is ten times higher than that found for bare BiVO4. The selective deposition of cobalt (oxy)hydroxide species onto the more electron-deficient facet of truncated bipyramidal monoclinic BiVO4 particles favors photogenerated charge carrier separation and therefore plays a key role for efficient photochemical oxygen evolution.},

Results often vary amongst standard packages, hindering autonomous materials development by requiring continuous user attention and educated guesses. This article presents a robust procedure for evaluating the complete suite of symmetry properties, featuring various representations for the point, factor and space groups, site symmetries and Wyckoff positions. The protocol determines a system-specific mapping tolerance that yields symmetry operations entirely commensurate with fundamental crystallographic principles. The self-consistent tolerance characterizes the effective spatial resolution of the reported atomic positions. The approach is compared with the most used programs and is successfully validated against the space-group information provided for over 54\>000 entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Subsequently, a complete symmetry analysis is applied to all 1.7+ million entries of the               AFLOW               data repository.

  abstract = {In order to confirm the existence of a first-order melting transition for a classical many-body system of hard spheres and to discover the densities of the coexisting phases, we have made a Monte Carlo determination of the pressure and absolute entropy of the hard-sphere solid. We use these solid-phase thermodynamic properties, coupled with known fluid-phase data, to show that the hard-sphere solid, at a density of 0.74 relative to close packing, and the hard-sphere fluid, at a density of 0.67 relative to close packing, satisfy the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of equal pressure and chemical potential at constant temperature. To get the solid-phase entropy, we integrated the Monte Carlo pressure--volume equation of state for a ``single-occupancy'' system in which the center of each hard sphere was constrained to occupy its own private cell. Such a system is no different from the ordinary solid at high density, but at low density its entropy and pressure are both lower. The difference in entropy between an unconstrained system of particles and a constrained one, with one particle per cell, is the so-called ``communal entropy,'' the determination of which has been a fundamental problem in the theory of liquids. Our Monte Carlo measurements show that communal entropy is nearly a linear function of density.},

Tetrahedral structures inspired by the bonding of carbon atoms have long been targeted as candidates for metamaterials and are now becoming accessible through molecular mimetic colloidal building blocks. Beyond carbon mimics, increasingly complex particles are being synthesized that can be arranged in their own periodic table and used to generate forms of matter unique to colloidal systems. This Review presents a framework to describe the synthesis of these micrometre-scale colloids, in which the fundamental constituents are either combined through interparticle reactions or transformed through intraparticle reactions, in analogy to molecules in traditional synthetic chemistry. We build on this framework to illustrate how unique particle shape and surface chemistry leads to diverse assembly routes for these colloidal building blocks.},

We leverage the fact that most objects found in man-made environments contain a plane of symmetry. By reflecting the points of each set with respect to the plane of symmetry, we can largely increase the overlap between the sets and therefore boost the registration process. However, prior knowledge about the plane of symmetry is generally unavailable or at least very hard to find, especially with limited partial views. Finding this plane could strongly benefit from a prior alignment of the partial point sets. We solve this chicken-and-egg problem by jointly optimizing the relative pose and symmetry plane parameters. We present a globally optimal solver by employing the branch-and-bound paradigm and thereby demonstrate that joint symmetry plane fitting leads to a great improvement over the current state of the art in globally optimal point set registration for common objects. We conclude with an interesting application of our method to dense 3D reconstruction of scenes with repetitive objects.},

  abstract = {Background: Calculation of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the atomic coordinates of two optimally superposed structures is a basic component of structural comparison techniques. We describe a quaternion based method, GPU-Q-J, that is stable with single precision calculations and suitable for graphics processor units (GPUs). The application was implemented on an ATI 4770 graphics card in C/C++ and Brook+ in Linux where it was 260 to 760 times faster than existing unoptimized CPU methods. Source code is available from the Compbio website http://software.compbio.washington.edu/misc/downloads/st\_gpu\_fit/ or from the author LHH. Findings: The Nutritious Rice for the World Project (NRW) on World Community Grid predicted de novo, the structures of over 62,000 small proteins and protein domains returning a total of 10 billion candidate structures. Clustering ensembles of structures on this scale requires calculation of large similarity matrices consisting of RMSDs between each pair of structures in the set. As a real-world test, we calculated the matrices for 6 different ensembles from NRW. The GPU method was 260 times faster that the fastest existing CPU based method and over 500 times faster than the method that had been previously used. Conclusions: GPU-Q-J is a significant advance over previous CPU methods. It relieves a major bottleneck in the clustering of large numbers of structures for NRW. It also has applications in structure comparison methods that involve multiple superposition and RMSD determination steps, particularly when such methods are applied on a proteome and genome wide scale.},

  abstract = {Finite size artifacts arise in molecular simulations of nucleation when critical nuclei are too close to their periodic images. A rigorous determination of what constitutes too close is, however, a major challenge. Recently, we devised rigorous heuristics for detecting such artifacts based on our investigation of how system size impacts the rate of heterogeneous ice nucleation [S. Hussain and A. Haji-Akbari, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 014108 (2021)]. We identified the prevalence of critical nuclei spanning across the periodic boundary, and the thermodynamic and structural properties of the liquid occupying the inter-image region as indicators of finite size artifacts. Here, we further probe the performance of such heuristics by examining the dependence of homogeneous crystal nucleation rates in the Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid on system size. The rates depend non-monotonically on system size and vary by almost six orders of magnitude for the range of system sizes considered here. We confirm that the prevalence of spanning critical nuclei is the primary indicator of finite size artifacts and almost fully explains the observed variations in rate. Proximity, or structuring of the inter-image liquid, however, is not as strong of an indicator due to the fragmented nature of crystalline nuclei. As a result, the dependence of rate on system size is subtle for the systems with a minuscule fraction of spanning critical nuclei. These observations indicate that our heuristics are universally applicable to different modes of nucleation (homogeneous and heterogeneous) in different systems even if they might be overly stringent for homogeneous nucleation, e.g., in the LJ system.},

  abstract = {The surprising recent discoveries of quasicrystals and their approximants in soft-matter systems poses the intriguing possibility that these structures can be realized in a broad range of nanoscale and microscale assemblies. It has been theorized that soft-matter quasicrystals and approximants are largely entropically stabilized, but the thermodynamic mechanism underlying their formation remains elusive. Here, we use computer simulation and free-energy calculations to demonstrate a simple design heuristic for assembling quasicrystals and approximants in soft-matter systems. Our study builds on previous simulation studies of the self-assembly of dodecagonal quasicrystals and approximants in minimal systems of spherical particles with complex, highly specific interaction potentials. We demonstrate an alternative entropy-based approach for assembling dodecagonal quasicrystals and approximants based solely on particle functionalization and shape, thereby recasting the interaction-potential-based assembly strategy in terms of simpler-to-achieve bonded and excluded-volume interactions. Here, spherical building blocks are functionalized with mobile surface entities to encourage the formation of structures with low surface contact area, including non-close-packed and polytetrahedral structures. The building blocks also possess shape polydispersity, where a subset of the building blocks deviate from the ideal spherical shape, discouraging the formation of close-packed crystals. We show that three different model systems with both of these features---mobile surface entities and shape polydispersity---consistently assemble quasicrystals and/or approximants. We argue that this design strategy can be widely exploited to assemble quasicrystals and approximants on the nanoscale and microscale. In addition, our results further elucidate the formation of soft-matter quasicrystals in experiment.},

  abstract = {Most simulations of colloidal suspensions treat the solvent implicitly or as a continuum. However as particle size decreases to the nanometer scale, this approximation fails and one needs to treat the solvent explicitly. Due to the large number of smaller solvent particles, such simulations are computationally challenging. Additionally, as the ratio of nanoparticle size to solvent size increases, commonly-used molecular dynamics algorithms for neighbor finding and parallel communication become inefficient. Here we present modified algorithms that enable fast single processor performance and reasonable parallel scalability for mixtures with a wide range of particle size ratios. The methods developed are applicable for any system with widely varying force distance cutoffs, independent of particle sizes and independent of the interaction potential. As a demonstration of the new algorithm's effectiveness, we present results for the pair correlation function and diffusion constant for mixtures where colloidal particles interact via integrated potentials. In these systems, with nanoparticles 20 times larger than the surrounding solvent particles, our parallel molecular dynamics code runs more than 100 times faster using the new algorithms.},

  abstract = {Neural networks can achieve impressive performance on many natural language processing applications, but they typically need large labeled data for training and are not easily interpretable. On the other hand, symbolic rules such as regular expressions are interpretable, require no training, and often achieve decent accuracy; but rules cannot benefit from labeled data when available and hence underperform neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this paper, we propose a type of recurrent neural networks called FA-RNNs that combine the advantages of neural networks and regular expression rules. An FA-RNN can be converted from regular expressions and deployed in zero-shot and cold-start scenarios. It can also utilize labeled data for training to achieve improved prediction accuracy. After training, an FA-RNN often remains interpretable and can be converted back into regular expressions. We apply FA-RNNs to text classification and observe that FA-RNNs significantly outperform previous neural approaches in both zeroshot and low-resource settings and remain very competitive in rich-resource settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Gender-affirming vaginoplasty aims to create the external female genitalia (vulva) as well as the internal vaginal canal; however, not all patients desire nor can safely undergo vaginal canal creation. Aim: Our objective is to describe the factors influencing patient choice or surgeon recommendation of vulvoplasty and to assess the patient's satisfaction with this choice. Methods: Gender-affirming genital surgery consults were reviewed from March 2015 until December 2017, and patients scheduled for or who had completed vulvoplasty were interviewed by telephone. Outcomes: We report demographic data and the reasons for choosing vulvoplasty as gender-affirming surgery for patients who either completed or were scheduled for surgery, in addition to patient reports of satisfaction with choice of surgery, satisfaction with the surgery itself, and sexual activity after surgery. Results: In total, 486 patients were seen in consultation for trans-feminine gender-affirming genital surgery: 396 requested vaginoplasty and 39 patients requested vulvoplasty. 30 Patients either completed or are scheduled for vulvoplasty. Vulvoplasty patients were older and had higher body mass index than those seeking vaginoplasty. The majority (63\%) of the patients seeking vulvoplasty chose this surgery despite no contra-indications to vaginoplasty. The remaining patients had risk factors leading the surgeon to recommend vulvoplasty. Of those who completed surgery, 93\% were satisfied with the surgery and their decision for vulvoplasty. Clinical Translation: Vulvoplasty creates the external appearance of female genitalia without creation of a neovaginal canal; it is associated with high satisfaction and low decision regret. Conclusions: This is the first study of factors impacting a patient's choice of or a surgeon's recommendation for vulvoplasty over vaginoplasty as gender-affirming genital surgery; it also is the first reported series of patients undergoing vulvoplasty only. Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, non-validated questions, short-term follow-up, and selection bias in how we offer vulvoplasty. Vulvoplasty is a form of gender-affirming feminizing surgery that does not involve creation of a neovagina, and it is associated with high satisfaction and low decision regret.

Furthermore, only minor modifications are required to incorporate the pruning procedure. The presented bounds are independent of the dimension, and empirical evidence shows that the pruning procedure remains effective in dimensions up to at least 200. In some cases, performance improvements of two orders of magnitude are observed for large data sets.},

Using global order parameters and local environment descriptors, we describe how particle shape influences the development of orientational order with increasing density, and we provide design rules based on the arrangement of facets for engineering plastic crystal behavior in colloidal systems.},

  abstract = {Many standard structural quantities, such as order parameters and correlation functions, exist for common condensed matter systems, such as spherical and rod-like particles. However, these structural quantities are often insufficient for characterizing the unique and highly complex structures often encountered in the emerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, or other disciplines involving complex structures such as computational biology. Computer science algorithms known as ``shape matching'' methods pose a unique solution to this problem by providing robust metrics for quantifying the similarity between pairs of arbitrarily complex structures. This pairwise matching operation, either implicitly or explicitly, lies at the heart of most standard structural characterization schemes for particle systems. By substituting more robust ``shape descriptors'' into these schemes we extend their applicability to structures formed from more complex building blocks. Here, we describe several structural characterization schemes and shape descriptors that can be used to obtain various types of structural information about particle systems. We demonstrate the application of shape matching algorithms to a variety of example problems, for topics including local and global structure identification and classification, automated phase diagram mapping, and the construction of spatial and temporal correlation functions. The methods are applicable to a wide range of systems, both simulated and experimental, provided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.},

We demonstrate how shape matching techniques can be applied to identify unknown structures and create highly-specialized {\textbackslash}textit\{ad hoc\} order parameters. Additionally, we investigate the special symmetry properties of harmonic descriptors, and demonstrate how they can be exploited to provide optimal solutions to certain classes of problems.

Herein, we propose a simple, one-step method that can control the two-dimensional (2D) alignment of MOF particles over large areas. Orientational control is achieved without consideration of the underlying lattice parameters or the need for particle surface modification, but instead was achieved by selection of the casting solvent on a water surface. Two distinct types of MOF particles, a hexagonal bifrustum morphology of MIL-96 and an octahedral morphology of the UiO-66 family were aligned and captured in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix using this approach. This work provides opportunities for studying and utilizing the anisotropic properties of MOFs in thin film applications.},

Synthesis efforts and self-assembly experiments have been assisted by computer simulations that predict phase equilibria. Most current simulations employ Monte Carlo methods, which generate stochastic dynamics. Collective and correlated configuration updates are alternatives that promise higher computational efficiency and generate trajectories with realistic dynamics. One such alternative involves event-chain updates and has recently been proposed for spherical particles. In this contribution, we develop and apply event-chain Monte Carlo for hard convex polyhedra. Our simulation makes use of an improved computational geometry algorithm XenoSweep, which predicts sweep collision in a particularly simple way. We implement Newtonian event chains in the open-source general-purpose particle simulation toolkit HOOMD-blue for serial and parallel simulation. The speedup over state-of-the-art Monte Carlo is between a factor of 10 for nearly spherical polyhedra and a factor of 2 for highly aspherical polyhedra. Finally, we validate the Newtonian eventchain algorithm by applying it to a current research problem, the multistep nucleation of two classes of hard polyhedra.},

Based on previous studies, it is expected that this estradiol-based COC will have a reduced hepatic effect compared with COCs containing ethinylestradiol with regard to proteins controlling the hemostatic balance. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the hemostatic effects of the estradiol valerate/dienogest COC with a monophasic low-estrogen dose COC containing ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel. Study Design: Healthy women aged 18--50 years were randomized to receive a COC containing estradiol valerate/dienogest (2 days estradiol valerate 3 mg, 5 days estradiol valerate 2 mg/dienogest 2 mg, 17 days estradiol valerate 2 mg/dienogest 3 mg, 2 days estradiol valerate 1 mg, 2 days placebo) or ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg in a crossover study design. Women received each treatment for three cycles, with two washout cycles between treatments. The primary efficacy variables were the intra-individual absolute changes in prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer from baseline to cycle three. Results: Data from 29 women were assessed. Intra-individual absolute changes in prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer from baseline to cycle three were less pronounced with estradiol valerate/dienogest than with ethinylestradiol/ levonorgestrel. Conclusion: The novel COC containing estradiol valerate/dienogest had similar or less pronounced effects on hemostatic parameters than ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel.},

  abstract = {Rock particle shape plays a crucial role in shear resistance and energy consumption during transient loads. The dynamics of such granular materials are complex and cannot be properly described using closed-form solutions when the problem involves more than a few particles. Thus, for the sake of computational efficiency, it is common practice to implement simplified numerical models that involve a limited number of particle interactions. In this study, a novel approach is used to capture realistic particle shapes while maintaining a relatively high simulation efficiency. The geometry of the particles is determined by a Delaunay triangulation which operates on a set of vertices and returns the corresponding network of facets and grid connections. Inertial and material properties are assigned to the rock prototype which are representative of realistic gravel particles. The algorithm is validated by performing a series of numerical simulations for various particle configurations, demonstrating that mass and momentum are conserved. A potential application of this work is related to rockfall barriers and their response to rigid boulder impacts. This innovative model, based on the discrete element method, is shown to be capable of simulating rock particles with realistic shapes and complex physical interactions.},

  abstract = {There are two chiral Archimedean polyhedra, the snub cube and snub dodecahedron together with their dual Catalan solids, pentagonal icositetrahedron and pentagonal hexacontahedron. In this paper we construct the chiral polyhedra and their dual solids in a systematic way. We use the proper rotational subgroups of the Coxeter groups and to derive the orbits representing the solids of interest. They lead to the polyhedra tetrahedron, icosahedron, snub cube, and snub dodecahedron respectively. We prove that the tetrahedron and icosahedron can be transformed to their mirror images by the proper rotational octahedral group~so they are not classified in the class of chiral polyhedra. It is noted that vertices of the snub cube and snub dodecahedron can be derived from the vectors, which are linear combinations of the simple roots, by the actions of the proper rotation groupsand ~respectively. Their duals are constructed as the unions of three orbits of the groups of concern. We also construct the polyhedra, quasiregular in general, by combining chiral polyhedra with their mirror images. As a by-product we obtain the pyritohedral group as the subgroup the Coxeter group and discuss the constructions of pyritohedrons. We employ a method which describes the Coxeter groups and their orbits in terms of quaternions.},

  abstract = {Hard convex polyhedra, idealized models for anisotropic colloids and nanoparticles, are known to form variety of orientational phases despite the regular arrangement of particles in the crystalline assemblies. Based on the orientational behavior of the constituents particles, such phases could be categorized into freely rotating plastic crystals (PC), discrete plastic crystals (DPC) and orientationally ordered crystals (OC). In this article, we report an extensive Monte Carlo computer simulation study of sixty hard convex polyhedral shape indicating a direct predictive relationship between the nature of orientational phases in the crystalline assemblies and single-particle shape attributes. The influence of three attributes namely; (i) Isoperimetric Quotient (IQ) i.e., the extent of asphericity; (ii) isotropy of the moment of inertia tensor in the principal frame and (iii) number of symmetry operations in the point group of the particle and self-assembled crystal structure, were observed to control the orientational phase behavior of the entire solid region in many-body system. The translational order in the crystal appeared to play significant role only in the DPC phase, where as, other two phases were completely governed by the combination of two attributes. In this study, the role of shape attributes were characterized by sequential appearance of one or two of the aforementioned rotational phases across the phase diagram in a pressure dependent manner which could be regarded as an important stepping stone towards fully predictive self-assembly behavior of hard particle systems.},

  abstract = {Successful scientific applications of large-scale molecular dynamics often rely on automated methods for identifying the local crystalline structure of condensed phases. Many existing methods for structural identification, such as common neighbour analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds thereof) to classify atomic structure. As a consequence they are sensitive to strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable identifications. We propose a new method, polyhedral template matching (PTM), which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic environment, without any ambiguity in the classification, and with greater reliability than e.g. common neighbour analysis in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples, and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.},

In this paper, an attractive algorithm for computing bounding spheres under such conditions is proposed. The method is based on selecting a set of k extremal points along s = k/2 input directions. In general, the method is able to compute better fitting spheres than Ritter's algorithm at roughly the same speed. Furthermore, the algorithm computes almost optimal spheres significantly faster than the best known smallest enclosing ball methods. Experimental evidence is provided which illustrates the qualities of the approach as compared to five other competing methods. Also, the experimental result gives insight into how the parameter s affects the tightness of fit and computation speed.},

  abstract = {The constrained orthogonal Procrustes problem is the least-squares problem that                 calls for a rotation matrix that optimally aligns two matrices of the same order.                 Over past decades, the algorithm of choice for solving this problem has been the                 Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm which is essentially no more than the computation of the                 singular value decomposition of a particular matrix. Its justification as presented                 separately by Kabsch and Umeyama is not totally algebraic as it is based on solving                 the minimization problem via Lagrange multipliers. In order to provide a more                 transparent alternative, it is the main purpose of this paper to present a purely                 algebraic justification of the algorithm through the exclusive use of simple                 concepts from linear algebra. For the sake of completeness, a proof is also included                 of the well-known and widely-used fact that the orientation-preserving rigid motion                 problem, i.e., the least-squares problem that calls for an orientation-preserving                 rigid motion that optimally aligns two corresponding sets of points in d-dimensional                 Euclidean space, reduces to the constrained orthogonal Procrustes problem.},

  abstract = {Bottlebrush block polymers are a promising platform for self-assembled photonic materials, yet most work has been limited to one-dimensional photonic crystals based on the lamellar phase. Here we demonstrate with simulation that nonfrustrated ABC bottlebrush block polymers can be used to self-assemble three-dimensional photonic crystals with complete photonic band gaps. To show this, we have developed a computational approach that couples self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations to Maxwell's equations, thereby permitting a direct link between molecular design, self-assembly, and photonic band structures. Using this approach, we calculate the phase diagram of nonfrustrated ABC bottlebrush block polymers and identify regions where the alternating gyroid and alternating diamond phases are stable. By computing the photonic band structures of these phases, we demonstrate that complete band gaps can be found in regions of thermodynamic stability, thereby suggesting a route to realize these photonic materials experimentally. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gap size depends on volume fraction, segregation strength, and polymer architecture, and we identify a design strategy based on symmetry breaking that can achieve band gaps for lower values of refractive index contrast. Taken together, the approach presented here provides a powerful and flexible tool for predicting both the self-assembly and photonic band structures of polymeric materials.},

  abstract = {In this work, we prepared a series of Fe-MOF polyhedra [metal organic framework (MOF)-1 {$\sim$} -13] by introducing {$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (CD) as a morphology modifier using an interaction between ferric chloride and terephthalic acid in dimethylformamide. A novel structural evolution from a hexagonal bipyramid to a bipyramidal hexagonal prism was clearly observed. This evolution was gradual and could be well reflected by the height ratio of the prism and pyramid in these polyhedral structures. It is the relative concentration of {$\beta$}-CD that drives this structural evolution. Although the reaction temperature and time can also affect the height ratio to some extent, their influence can only be realized in the presence of {$\beta$}CD. In the absence of {$\beta$}-CD, only hexagonal bipyramid structures were obtained. It is worth noting that Fe-MOF-1 with a bipyramidal hexagonal prism structure (prism height, {$\sim$}130 nm) showed typical paramagnetic characteristics, and its saturation magnetization was determined to be 23.1 emu{$\cdot$}g-1. Furthermore, we found that FeMOF-1 exhibited good photocatalytic performance for different types of dyes (crystal violet with positives and methyl orange with negative charges). At the same time, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed to explain the difference of degradation efficiency between the two dyes. Also, we use the combination of specific surface area and zeta potential to explain the differences in the catalytic properties of a series of Fe-MOF materials. In addition, MOF-1 shows the same electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance as some bimetallic MOFs such as Fe-Co-MOF. For example, the overpotential of MOF-1 is 398 mV at 10 mA{$\cdot$}cm-2 current density, while that of Fe-Co-MOF is 410 mV. We believe that the current work can contribute to the adjustment, modification, and application of MOF nanostructures.},

In this work, we propose two variational convex hull models using level set representation for 2-dimensional data. The first one is an exact model, which can get the convex hull of one or multiple objects. In this model, the convex hull is characterized by the zero sublevel-set of a convex level set function, which is non-positive at every given point. By minimizing the area of the zero sublevel-set, we can find the desired convex hull. The second one is intended to get convex hull of objects with outliers. Instead of requiring all the given points are included, this model penalizes the distance from each given point to the zero sublevel-set. Literature methods are not able to handle outliers. For the solution of these models, we develop efficient numerical schemes using alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.},

Bipyramidal nanoparticle shapes are synthesizable from gold and silver, with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers. We report numerous colloidal crystalline phases with varying symmetries and complexities as the bipyramid aspect ratio and base polygon are varied. Some bipyramids are mesogenic and undergo either monotropic or enantiotropic phase transitions. We show that such mesophase behavior can be modulated by tuning the bipyramid aspect ratio. In addition, we report stepwise kinetic crystallization and melting pathways that occur via an intermediate mesophase as the system gains or loses order in successive stages. Our results demonstrate that complex phase transition behavior involving mesophases can be driven by entropy alone. Importantly, our results can guide the synthesis of bipyramid shapes able to assemble target structures and can be used to engineer the kinetic pathways to and from those structures to involve or avoid mesophases.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles into highly ordered superlattices could pave the way toward novel nanomaterials for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Here, we propose the formation of large-area superlattices of elongated rhombic dodecahedra in a vertical orientation via a controlled droplet evaporation process. Expectedly, the constant humidity of the experimental condition could control the evaporation speed of droplets and this procedure promotes the balance between driven depletion attraction and electrostatic repulsion in the system, leading to the generation of well-organized threedimensional (3D) superlattices. The unique geometry of elongated rhombic dodecahedra could establish the tetragonal superlattices, which breaks the conventional hexagonal symmetry of gold nanorods. Specifically, the influence of the type and concentration of surfactants, the concentration of nanoparticles, and the amount of droplets on the preparation results were systematically investigated to find the optimal assembly parameters. Remarkably, such close-packed tetragonal arrays of vertically aligned elongated rhombic dodecahedra exhibit more excellent SERS performance compared with the traditional hexagonal superstructure of gold nanorods. Benefiting from the high sensitivity and reproducibility of elongated rhombic dodecahedron superlattices, their applications in the determination of pesticide residues in apple and grape peels were successfully demonstrated. As a result, this study may advance the production of innovative plasmonic nanomaterials for a broad range of fields.},

To this end, we have introduced and demonstrated prototypes of what we call colloidal state machines (CSMs) as particulate devices capable of integrating sensing, memory, and energy harvesting as well as other functions onto a single particle. One technique that we have introduced for creating CSMs based on 2D materials such as graphene or monolayer MoS               2               is ``autoperforation'', where the nanometer-scale film is fractured around a designed strain field to produce structured particles upon liftoff. While CSMs have been demonstrated with functions such as memory, sensing, and energy harvesting, the property of locomotion has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we introduce an inversion moulding technique compatible with autoperforation that allows for the patterning of an external catalytic surface that enables locomotion in an accompanying fuel bath. Optimal processing conditions for electroplating a catalytic Pt layer to one side of an autoperforated CSM are elucidated. The self-driven propulsion of the resulting Janus CSM in H               2               O               2               is studied, including the average velocity, as a function of fluid surface tension and H               2               O               2               concentration in the bath. Since machines have to encode for a specific task, this work summarizes efforts to create a microfluidic testbed that allows for CSM designs to be evaluated for the ultimate purpose of navigation through complex fluidic networks, such as the human circulatory system. We introduce two CSM designs that mimic aspects of human immunity to solve search and recruitment tasks in such environments. These results advance CSM design concepts closer to promising applications in medicine and other areas.},

Here, we present a simple and robust algorithm to rapidly determine the optimal rotation using a Newton-Raphson quaternion-based method and an adjoint matrix. Our method is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than conventional inversion/decomposition methods, and it should be particularly useful for high-throughput analyses of molecular conformations.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive framework of characterizing complex self-assembled structures with a set of orientational order parameters is presented. It is especially relevant in the context of using anisotropic building blocks with various symmetries. Two classes of tensor order parameters are associated with polyhedral nematic and bond orientational order. For the latter, a variation of classical bond order parameters (BOPs) is introduced, which takes advantage of the symmetry of constituent particles and/or expected crystalline phases. These symmetrized BOPs can be averaged over an entire system or assigned locally to an individual bond. By combining that with the bond percolation procedure, one is able to identify coherent domains within a self-assembled structure. As a demonstration of the proposed framework, we apply it to a simulated hybrid system that combines isotropic and patchy particles with octahedral symmetry. Not only does the methodology allow one to identify individual crystalline domains but also it detects coherent clusters of a peculiar compact amorphous structure that is not space-filling and lacks any long-range order.},

  abstract = {Static light scattering may be used to probe the solution behavior of complexes of integral membrane proteins with detergents. As has been observed with soluble proteins, the crystallization behavior of protein--detergent complexes can be reliably predicted by the second osmotic virial coefficient (B22), which is obtained from light scattering. Conditions which yield crystals map to a narrow window of B22 values falling within the ``crystallization slot'' previously described for soluble proteins. This slot lies near the cloud point of the detergent used for crystallization. The detergent portion of the protein--detergent complex appears to be an important factor in determining the B22 values for the complex. This suggests a strategy for the design of membrane protein crystallization screens which focuses principally on optimization of detergent--detergent interactions. Cloud point assays have been developed to facilitate collection of the data necessary to construct such screens. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new application of polyhedral theory to the growth of the outer sheath of certain viruses. Such structures are often modular, consisting of one or two types of units arranged in a symmetric pattern. In particular, the polyoma virus has a structure apparently related to the snub dodecahedron. Here, we consider the problem of how such patterns might grow in time, starting from a given number               N               of randomly placed circles on the surface of a sphere. The circles are first jostled by random perturbations, then their radii are enlarged, then they are jostled again, and so on. This `yin--yang' method of growth can result in some very close packings. When               N               =12, the closest packing corresponds to the snub tetrahedron, and when               N               =24 the closest packing corresponds to the snub cube. However, when               N               =60 the closest packing does not correspond to the snub dodecahedron but to a less-symmetric arrangement. Special attention is given to the structure of the human polyoma virus, for which               N               =72. It is shown that the yin--yang procedure successfully assembles the observed structure provided that the 72 circles are pre-assembled in clusters of six. Each cluster consists of five circles arranged symmetrically around a sixth at the centre, as in a flower with five petals. This has implications for the assembly of the capsomeres in a polyoma virus.},

The proposed methodology was verified by comparing simulations of trimers diluted in spheres and of single-component dimer systems with results from the literature. Then, the method was applied to mixtures of hard-spheres and dimers at several conditions regarding composition, reduced density, and bond-length/diameter ratio. The results were used to validate equations of state from the literature. The proposed approach was able to obtain accurate chemical potentials for different hard-core molecular mixtures. Lower uncertainties were obtained when comparing with traditional methods, especially at high densities.},

  abstract = {Protein structures are routinely compared by their root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) in atomic coordinates after optimal rigid body superposition. What is not so clear is the significance of different RMSD values, particularly above the customary arbitrary cutoff for obvious similarity of 2-3 A. Our earlier work argued for an intrinsic cutoff for protein similarity that varied with the number of residues in the polypeptide chains being compared. Here we introduce a new measure, p, of structural similarity based on RMSD that is independent of the sizes of the molecules involved, or of any other special properties of molecules. When p is less than 0.44.5, protein structures are visually recognized to be obviously similar, but the mathematically pleasing intrinsic cutoff of p{$<$} 1.0 corresponds to overall similarity in folding motif at a level not usually recognized until smoothing of the polypeptide chain path makes it striking. When the structures are scaled to unit radius of gyration and equal principle moments of inertia, the comparisons are even more universal, since they are no longer obscured by differences in overall size and ellipticity. With increasing chain length, the distribution of p for pairs of random structures is skewed to higher values, but the value for the best 1\%of the comparisons rises only slowly with the number of residues. This level is close to a n intrinsic cutoff between similar and dissimilar comparisons, namely the maximal scaled p possible for the two structures to be more similar to each other than one is to the other's mirror image. The intrinsic cutoff is independent of the number of residues or points being compared. For proteins having fewer than 100 residues, the 1\%p falls below the intrinsic cutoff, so that for very small proteins, geometrically significant similarity can often occur by chance. We believe these ideas will be helpful in judging success in NMR structure determination and protein folding modeling. 01995 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

  abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticles can be beautiful, as in stained glass windows, or they can be ugly as in wear and corrosion debris from implants. We estimate that there will be about 70 000 papers in 2015 with nanoparticles as a keyword, but only one in thirteen uses the nanoparticle shape as an additional keyword and research focus, and only one in two hundred has thermodynamics. Methods for synthesizing nanoparticles have exploded over the last decade, but our understanding of how and why they take their forms has not progressed as fast. This topical review attempts to take a critical snapshot of the current understanding, focusing more on methods to predict than a purely synthetic or descriptive approach. We look at models and themes which are largely independent of the exact synthetic method whether it is deposition, gas-phase condensation, solution based or hydrothermal synthesis. Elements are old dating back to the beginning of the 20th century---some of the pioneering models developed then are still relevant today. Others are newer, a merging of older concepts such as kineticWulff constructions with methods to understand minimum energy shapes for particles with twins. Overall we find that while there are still many unknowns, the broad framework of understanding and predicting the structure of nanoparticles via diverse Wulff constructions, either thermodynamic, local minima or kinetic has been exceedingly successful. However, the field is still developing and there remain many unknowns and new avenues for research, a few of these being suggested towards the end of the review.},

Such clusters, created experimentally by fusing spheres, can facilitate assembly of useful colloidal crystal symmetries not attainable by unclustered spheres. While not crucial for their self-assembly, the center of the PSC can contain a ``core'' particle that can be used as a scaffold to build the PSC. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show the self-assembly of eight distinct crystalline phases from PSCs that correspond to the five Platonic polyhedra, and that are made of spheres with purely repulsive interactions. Strong crystalline order is seen in the centers of mass of the PSCs, or equivalently the core particles. The halo particles also may organize into crystal structures, usually with weaker crystalline order than the core particles. Notably, however, in crystals assembled from the octahedral and icosahedral PSCs, the halo particles are also well ordered, nesting within the crystals formed by the cores. Interestingly, despite the rounded nature of the PSCs, in some cases we obtain structures similar to those of the corresponding faceted polyhedra interacting only               via               excluded volume. Only the tetrahedral PSCs fail to self-assemble into a crystal, but we demonstrate that a pre-assembled crystal -- whose halo particles sit on a close-packed face-centered cubic lattice, and whose core particles form a diamond structure -- is stable at high density and melts into a hexagonal phase at lower density.},

The proposed methodology robustly handles rank-deficient matrices and guarantees orthonormality of the computed rotational factors.

In particular, it does not require any explicit branching beyond simple conditional assignments (as in the C++ ternary operator ?:, or the SSE4.1 instruction VBLENDPS), enabling trivial data-level parallelism for any number of operations. Furthermore, no trigonometric or other expensive operations are required; the only floating point operations utilized are addition, multiplication, and an inexact (yet fast) reciprocal square root which is broadly available on current SIMD/vector architectures. The performance observed approaches the limit of making the 3 {\texttimes} 3 SVD a memory-bound (as opposed to CPU-bound) operation on current SMP platforms.},

Among these materials, anisotropic particles are particularly interesting because the decreased symmetry of such particles often leads to new and unusual chemical and physical behavior. Within this class of particles, triangular Au and Ag nanoprisms stand out due to their structure- and environment-dependent optical features, their anisotropic surface energetics, and the emergence of reliable synthetic methods for producing them in bulk quantities with control over their edge lengths and thickness.

  abstract = {Introduction: Rising numbers of trans women are undergoing genital surgeries, such as vulvoplasty or vulvovaginoplasty, to create a neovagina. Medical professionals who adhere to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care, Version 7, and who recommend or perform these procedures, are expected to balance best practices with patient preferences, specifically the decision to create or omit the vaginal canal. Due to a paucity of literature on gender-confirming vulvoplasty (GCV) in trans women, there has been no documentation of factors that prompt practitioners to reject or recommend the procedure. Aim: The aim of the study was to provide descriptive data of WPATH-affiliated medical professionals' knowledge, experiences, and attitudes toward GCV; surgical risks, benefits, and any considerations when referring transgender women 18e21 years of age for this procedure. Methods: Purposive sampling of all physicians, surgeons, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered nurses listed in the WPATH membership directory was initiated via invitational e-mails. The 32-item survey focused on demographics, medical practices, surgical techniques, and reasons for recommending or rejecting the procedure. Data analysis included frequencies and Pearson's c2 test. Main Outcome Measures: Key outcome measures included frequency of cases performed; reasons for recommending, rejecting, or performing GCV; and differences in attitudes toward the procedure among various medical professionals. Results: N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 198 (20.7\%) of 956 solicited professionals completed the survey. Surgeons (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 61) comprised 30.8\% of the total sample. 46 surgeons (76.7\%) reported having performed vulvovaginoplasty, and 25 (41.7\%) had performed GCV. ``Patient request'' was the most common reason for recommending or performing GCV. Surgeons were more likely to either agree and perform (30.4\%), or reject (32.1\%) GCV in a patient aged 18e21 than other practitioners, who were more likely to be ``unsure'' (68.5\%). These differences were statistically significant (c2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 16.467 [2]; n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 193; P {$<$} .001). Clinical Implications: The data identify a lack of standardized terminology and surgical techniques concerning GCV. Strength \& Limitations: This is the first exploratory study to assess medical practitioner experiences and attitudes toward a seldom documented procedure. A larger, more inclusive sample would increase the statistical strength and representative aspect of the study. Conclusion: The study shows divergence in attitudes and knowledge among medical practitioners who recommend or perform GCV, and uncertainty when the patient is 18e21 years old. The study contributes to an expanded description and specific indications of performing GCV in the updated WPATH SOC Version 8. Milrod C, Monto M, Karasic DH.

Selected applications to multiscale modeling discussed here include dislocation core structure and mobility, atomistically informed dislocation dynamics simulations of plasticity, and thermoelasticity and high-pressure strength modeling. Recent algorithm improvements have provided a more general matrix representation of MGPT beyond canonical bands, allowing improved accuracy and extension to               f               -electron actinide metals, an order of magnitude increase in computational speed for dynamic simulations, and the development of temperature-dependent potentials.},

Two of the methods involve thermodynamic integration along an unphysical path ({$\lambda$} integration, {$\lambda$}I), and two involve integration in temperature from the low-temperature harmonic limit (T integration, TI). Specifically, the methods considered are (1) Frenkel-Ladd integration from a noninteracting Einstein crystal reference (ECR-{$\lambda$}I); (2) conventional integration in temperature (ConvTI); (3) integration from an interacting quasi-harmonic reference (QHR-{$\lambda$}I); and (4) temperature integration using harmonically mapped averaging to evaluate the integrand (HMA-TI). The latter two methods are ``harmonically assisted'', meaning that they exploit the harmonic nature of the crystal to greatly reduce fluctuations in the relevant averages. This feature allows them to deliver a result of much higher precision for a given computational effort, compared to ECR-{$\lambda$}I and Conv-TI, and with no less accuracy. Regarding the harmonically assisted methods, HMA-TI has several advantages over QHR-{$\lambda$}I with respect to the simplicity of the integration path (which promotes a more accurate result), ease of implementation, and usefulness of the data recorded along the integration path.},

  abstract = {The remarkable synthetically tunable structural, electronic, and optical properties of gold nanocrystals have attracted increasing interest and enabled multidisciplinary applications. Over the past decades, nearly all the possible fundamental shapes of faceted Au nanocrystals have been synthesized, except for only one missingthe trapezohedron enclosed by \{hkk\} facets. In this report, the unprecedented synthesis of trapezohedral Au nanocrystals with \{311\} crystal facets was realized. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was discovered as a solvent for shaping Au nanocrystals with \{311\} crystal facets for the first time. Mechanistic studies, together with previous DFT and STM studies, attribute the unique role of DMSO to its ambidentate nature, where both sulfur and oxygen of DMSO can coordinate to gold surface, endowing its unique role in stabilizing high-index \{311\} facets through a ``two center bonding'' mode. The DMSO-based synthesis provides a new synthetic tool toward the synthesis of a series of unreported Au nanocrystals with new structures. In particular, a new type of gold bipyramids, the octagonal bipyramids, was first synthesized with additional plasmonic tunability while simultaneously retaining their \{311\} facets. The application of these new Au nanocrystals in surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy was investigated, and their shape-dependent performances were demonstrated. These results highlight the tremendous potential of using ambidentate molecules as shape- and surface-directing agents for metal nanocrystals and offer the promise of enabling new synthetic tools toward atomically precise control of surface structures of metal nanocrystals.},

Design Plasma levels of factorVII, X, antithrombin 111,protein C, fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor I antigen and fibrin (D-dimer)degradation products were measured at pretreatment, 6, 14, 22 weeks of treatment and at 6 weeks post-treatmentin a group of 67 women taking either 30 pg ethinyloestradiol/l50 pg desogestrel (n = 21), 20 pg ethinyloestradiol/l50 pg desogestrel (n = 24), 30 pg ethinyloestradiol/75pg gestodene (n = 22). Participants Sixty-seven healthy normal women, 18 to 34 years, smoking fewer than 15 cigarettes per day. The subjects were within 10\% of their normal body weight and had no history of thromboembolic disease. Setting Coombe Women's Hospital and St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Results Factor VII and X levels were significantly raised on treatment with both the 30 pg ethinyloestradiol/desogestreland gestodene combinations.Higher levels of factor VII activity were observed in the 30 pg ethinyloestradiol/desogestrel combination compared with the gestodene combination. Factor VII and X were not significantly affected by the 20pg ethinyloestradiol combination. Increased plasminogen, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 antigen levels were observed during the treatment phases in all three groups. Antithrombin TI1 and protein C activity did not change during treatment with any of the oral contraceptives studied. Conclusions Low dose oral contraceptives cause an activation of the coagulation system which is balanced by an activation of the fibrinolytic system. Reducing the dose of ethinyloestradiol from 30 pg to 20 pg reduces the effect on factor VII and X. This effect can be modified by the progestogen. The lesser effect of the 20 pg combination may make this a safer option for some women than pills containing a higher dose of oestrogen.},

Hence, solely the entropic contribution can induce their self-assembling even in the absence of attractive forces.

  abstract = {A useful approximation has been found for the excluded volume integral for the interaction of a pair of polymer molecules, represented by Gaussian distributions of chain segments about their respective centers of gravity. By means of this approximation, the theoretical expression for the second virial coefficient in the expansion of the osmotic pressure is represented over the entire range of polymer-solvent interaction by A2=const\,([{$\eta$}]/M)\,ln[1+({$\pi$}12/4)X1+({$\pi$}12332/32)X2].X1 and X2 are related to the thermodynamic interaction parameters {$\chi$}1 and {$\chi$}2, respectively, in the semiempirical expression for the solvent chemical potential {$\mu$}1---{$\mu$}10=RT[ln(1---v2)+(1--1/x)v2+{$\chi$}1v22+ {$\chi$}2v23+{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}] where v2 is the volume fraction of polymer and x the ratio of molar volumes of polymer and solvent. Inclusion of the higher term {$\chi$}2v23 (and X2) constitutes a refinement over the treatment previously published. It is shown that the influence of X2 may be appreciable for low molecular weights and in poor solvents; its effect vanishes as the molecular weight becomes large. However, if X2{$\neq$}0, the temperature at which A2 for a given polymer-solvent pair becomes zero will, in general, depend upon the molecular weight. The similar influence of this term on the expression for the intramolecular expansion factor is smaller, although not necessarily negligible.             Interaction parameters ({$\chi$}1) are calculated from second virial coefficients for a number of polymer-solvent systems, and these are compared with the {$\chi$}1 values obtained from intrinsic viscosities (intramolecular theory). The good agreement obtained offers strong evidence for the general validity of the intermolecular (A2) and intramolecular theories.             A 2 increases slightly more rapidly with decrease in M than theory predicts. On the whole, however, the consistency of results is gratifyingly good.             The intrinsic viscosity increases linearly with A2M in poor solvents. This relation must be replaced by one of approximate direct proportionality in good solvents.},

The growth and stability of metallic clusters is extensively discussed through faceting and energy minimization mechanisms, respectively. Facet truncations on the regular Mackay-icosahedron (m-Ih) give rise to two subfamilies exhibiting five-fold symmetry and external decahedral shape. Such successive truncations made to the regular m-Ih, led to a decahedral motif called `Decmon' (Montejano's decahedron). This structure expose facets (111) and (100), that after a total energy minimization through molecular dynamics simulations using the embedded atom model, proved to be thermally stable. This result has been confirmed by using nano-thermodynamics. The surface energy competition between the (111) and (100) facets explains its stability at some given cluster sizes, and this truncation path permits to glimpse the potential energy surface in the growth path of nanoparticles from the decahedral (s-Dh) to icosahedral (m-Ih) structures.},

  abstract = {Bottom-up fabrication of complex 3D hollow superstructures from nonspherical building blocks (BBs) poses a significant challenge for scientists in materials chemistry and physics. Spherical colloidal silica or polystyrene particles are therefore often integrated as BBs for the preparation of an emerging class of materials, namely colloidosomes (using colloidal particles for Pickering stabilization and fusing them to form a permeable shell). Herein, we describe for the first time a one-step emulsion-based technique that permits the assembly of metal-organic framework (MOF) faceted polyhedral BBs (i.e., cubes instead of spheres) into 3D hollow superstructures (or ``colloidosomes''). The shell of each resultant hollow MOF colloidosome is constructed from a monolayer of cubic BBs, whose dimensions can be precisely controlled by varying the amount of emulsifier used in the synthesis.},

  abstract = {Particles interacting via isotropic, multiwell pair potentials have been shown to self-assemble into a range of crystal structures, yet how the characteristics of the underlying interaction potential give rise to the resultant structure remains largely unknown. We have thus developed a functional form for the interaction potential in which all features can be tuned independently. We perform continuous parameter space searches by systematically changing pairs of parameters, controlling the various features of the interaction potential. By enforcing a repulsive first well (controlling particle interactions of the first neighbor shell), we stimulate the formation of low-coordinated assemblies. We report the self-assembly of 20 previously unknown crystal structure types, 14 of which have low coordination numbers. Despite limiting the search to a small region of the vast parameter space of possible particle interactions, a wealth of complexity and symmetry is apparent within these crystal structures, which include clathrates with empty cages and low-symmetry structures. Our findings suggest that an unknown number of previously undiscovered crystal structure configurations are possible through self-assembly, which can serve as interesting design targets for soft condensed matter synthesis.},

While there is indeed a striking but cosmetic resemblance to the contextualized rewriting systems used by modern morphologists and phonologists, a subtle difference in how rules are prevented from applying cyclically leads to a massive difference in generative capacity. The formalism behind P{\textasciimacron}a .ninian grammar, in fact, generates string languages not even contained within any of the multiple-component tree-adjoining languages, MCTAL(k), for any k. There is ample evidence, nevertheless, that P{\textasciimacron}an. ini's grammar itself judiciously avoided the potential pitfalls of this unconstrained formalism to articulate a large-coverage, but seemingly very tractable grammar of the Sanskrit language.},

  abstract = {The second virial coefficient, B2, measures a protein solution's deviation from ideal behavior. It is widely used to predict or explain solubility, crystallization condition, aggregation propensity, and critical temperature for liquid-liquid phase separation. B2 is determined by the interaction energy between two protein molecules and, specifically, by the integration of the Mayer f-function in the relative configurational space (translation and rotation) of the two molecules. Simple theoretical models, such as one attributed to Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO), can fit the dependence of B2 on salt concentrations. However, model parameters derived often are physically unrealistic and hardly transferable from protein to protein. Previous B2 calculations incorporating atomistic details were done with limited sampling in the configurational space, due to enormous computational cost. Our FMAP method, based on fast Fourier transform, can considerably accelerate such calculations, and here we adapt it to calculate B2 values for proteins represented at the atomic level in implicit solvent. After tuning of a single parameter in the energy function, FMAPB2 predicts well the B2 values for lysozyme and other proteins over wide ranges of solvent conditions (salt concentration, pH, and temperature). The method is available as a web server at http://pipe.rcc.fsu.edu/fmapb2.},

  abstract = {If two rules are simultaneously applicable at a given step in a P{\=a}{\d n}inian derivation, which of the two should be applied? Put differently, in the event of a `conflict' between the two rules, which rule wins? In the A{\d s}{\d t}{\=a}dhy{\=a}y{\=i}, P{\=a}{\d n}ini has taught only one metarule, namely, 1.4.2 viprati{\d s}edhe para{\.m} k{\=a}ryam, to address this problem. Traditional scholars interpret it as follows: `in the event of a conflict between two rules of equal strength, the rule that comes later in the serial order of the A{\d s}{\d t}{\=a}dhy{\=a}y{\=i}, wins.' P{\=a}{\d n}in{\=i}yas claim that if one rule is nitya, and its simultaneously applicable counterpart is anitya, or if one is antara{\.n}ga and the other bahira{\.n}ga, or if one is an apav{\=a}da (exception) and the other the utsarga (general rule), then the two rules are not equally strong and consequently, we cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve the conflict between them. The nitya, antara{\.n}ga and apav{\=a}da rules are stronger than their respective counterparts and thus win against them. But this system of conflict resolution is far from perfect: the tradition has had to write numerous additional metarules to account for umpteen exceptions. In this thesis, I propose my own solution to the problem of rule conflict which I have developed by relying exclusively on P{\=a}{\d n}ini's A{\d s}{\d t}{\=a}dhy{\=a}y{\=i}. I replace the aforementioned traditional categories of rule conflict with a new classification, based on whether the two rules are applicable to the same operand (Same Operand Interaction, SOI), or to two different operands (Different Operand Interaction, DOI). I argue that, in case of SOI, the more specific i.e., the `exception' rule, wins. Additionally, I develop a systematic method for the identification of the `more specific' rule -- based on P{\=a}{\d n}ini's style of rule composition. I also argue that, in order to deal with DOI, P{\=a}{\d n}ini has composed 1.4.2, which I interpret as follows: `in case of DOI (viprati{\d s}edha), the right-hand side (para) operation (k{\=a}rya) prevails.' I support my conclusions with both textual and derivational evidence. I also discuss my interpretation of certain metarules teaching substitution and augmentation, the concept of a{\.n}ga, and the asiddha and asiddhavat rules and expound on not only their interaction with 1.4.2 but also their influence on the overall functioning of the P{\=a}{\d n}inian machine.},

The package provides the core tools for finding particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using these tools. As such, freud users can access standard methods such as the radial distribution function as well as newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of mean force and torque and local crystal environment analysis with equal ease. Rather than providing its own trajectory data structure, freud operates either directly on NumPy arrays or on trajectory data structures provided by other Python packages. This design allows freud to transparently interface with many trajectory file formats by leveraging the file parsing abilities of other trajectory management tools. By remaining agnostic to its data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any particle simulation, regardless of the original data representation or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as HOOMDblue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to the current state of the system, allowing users to study phenomena such as nucleation and growth.},

  abstract = {We introduce a mean-field theoretical framework for generalizing isotropic pair potentials to anisotropic shapes. This method is suitable for generating pair potentials that can be used in both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the application of this theory by deriving a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-like potential for arbitrary geometries along with a Weeks--Chandler--Anderson-like repulsive variant, showing that the resulting potentials behave very similarly to standard LJ potentials while also providing a nearly conformal mapping of the underlying shape. We then describe an implementation of this potential in the simulation engine HOOMD-blue and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to achieve a sufficiently robust and performant implementation. The resulting potential can be applied to smooth geometries like ellipsoids and to convex polytopes. We contextualize these applications with reference to the existing methods for simulating such particles. The pair potential is validated using standard criteria, and its performance is compared to existing methods for comparable simulations. Finally, we show the results of self-assembly simulations, demonstrating that this method can be used to study the assembly of anisotropic particles into crystal structures.},

  abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow around a charged spherical colloid near an electrode was studied theoretically and experimentally to understand the nature of long-range particle--particle attraction near electrodes. Numerical computations for finite double-layer thicknesses confirmed the validity of an asymptotic methodology for thin layers. Then the electric potential around the particle was computed analytically in the limit of zero P{\'e}clet number and thin double layers for oscillatory electric fields at frequencies where Faradaic reactions are negligible. Streamfunctions for the steady component of the EHD flow were determined with an electro-osmotic slip boundary condition on the electrode surface. Accordingly, it was established how the axisymmetric flow along the electrode is related to the dipole coefficient of the colloidal particle. Under certain conditions, the flow is directed toward the particle and decays as               r               -4               , in accord with observations of long-range particle aggregation. To test the theory, particle-tracking experiments were performed with fluorescent 300 nm particles around 50{$\mu$}m particles over a wide range of electric field strengths and frequencies. Treating the particle surface conductivity as a fitting parameter yields velocities in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. The observed frequency dependence, however, differs from the model predictions, suggesting that the effect of convection on the charge distribution is not negligible as assumed in the zero P{\'e}clet number limit.},

Here, we extend the digital alchemy framework for the inverse design of patchy spheres that self-assemble into target crystal structures. To constrain the potentials to non-trivial solutions, we conduct digital alchemy simulations with constant second virial coefficient. We optimize the size, range, and strength of patchy interactions in model triblock Janus spheres to self-assemble the 2D kagome and snub square lattices and the 3D pyrochlore lattice, and demonstrate self-assembly of all three target structures with the designed models. The particles designed for the kagome and snub square lattices assemble into high quality clusters of their target structures, while competition from similar polymorphs lower the yield of the pyrochlore assemblies. We find that the alchemically designed potentials do not always match physical intuition, illustrating the ability of the method to find nontrivial solutions to the optimization problem. We identify a window of second virial coefficients that result in self-assembly of the target structures, analogous to the crystallization slot in protein crystallization.},

The TB, Tmax, and B vs T behavior of several Lennard-Jones equations of state, developed from molecular simulation data, were compared with exact theoretical values. The analysis spanned low (T {$\leq$} TB), mid (TB {$<$} T {$\leq$} Tmax), and high (T {$\gg$} Tmax) temperatures. The value of TB was accurately predicted by most equations of state studied, whereas most failed to adequately predict Tmax. The ability to accurately predict both TB and Tmax appears to be correlated with the accurate prediction of B values for the entire range of temperatures. This provides a useful criterion to improve future potential-based equations of state. The Mecke et al. and Thol et al. LennardJones equations of state yielded the most accurate results. In some cases, a many-fold improvement in accuracy was observed compared with alternative equations of state.

In this paper, we show how, by carefully using some algebraic recipes scattered in the literature, it is possible to derive a simple and yet numerically stable formula for most practical applications. Moreover, by relying on a result that permits obtaining the quaternion corresponding to the sought optimal rotation matrix, we present another closed-form formula that provides a good approximation to the optimal one using only the elementary algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. These two closed-form formulas are compared with respect to the SVD in terms of accuracy and computational cost.},

  abstract = {The parameterization of rotations is a central topic in many theoretical and applied fields such as rigid body mechanics, multibody dynamics, robotics, spacecraft attitude dynamics, navigation, 3D image processing, computer graphics, etc. Nowadays, the main alternative to the use of rotation matrices, to represent rotations in R3, is the use of Euler parameters arranged in quaternion form. Whereas the passage from a set of Euler parameters to the corresponding rotation matrix is unique and straightforward, the passage from a rotation matrix to its corresponding Euler parameters has been revealed to be somewhat tricky if numerical aspects are considered. Since the map from quaternions to 3{\texttimes}3 rotation matrices is a 2-to-1 covering map, this map cannot be smoothly inverted. As a consequence, it is erroneously assumed that all inversions should necessarily contain singularities that arise in the form of quotients where the divisor can be arbitrarily small. This misconception is herein clarified.},

  abstract = {Significance             The Greeks described two classes of convex equilateral polyhedron with polyhedral symmetry, the Platonic (including the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron) and the Archimedean (including the truncated icosahedron with its soccer-ball shape). Johannes Kepler discovered a third class, the rhombic polyhedra. Some carbon fullerenes, inorganic cages, icosahedral viruses, protein complexes, and geodesic structures resemble these polyhedra. Here we add a fourth class, ``Goldberg polyhedra.'' Their small (corner) faces are regular 3gons, 4gons, or 5gons, whereas their planar 6gonal faces are equilateral but not equiangular. Unlike faceted viruses and related carbon fullerenes, the icosahedral Goldberg polyhedra are nearly spherical. The reasoning and techniques presented here will enable discovery of still more classes of convex equilateral polyhedron with polyhedral symmetry.           ,                             The three known classes of convex polyhedron with equal edge lengths and polyhedral symmetry----tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral----are the 5 Platonic polyhedra, the 13 Archimedean polyhedra----including the truncated icosahedron or soccer ball----and the 2 rhombic polyhedra reported by Johannes Kepler in 1611. (Some carbon fullerenes, inorganic cages, icosahedral viruses, geodesic structures, and protein complexes resemble these fundamental shapes.) Here we add a fourth class, ``Goldberg polyhedra,'' which are also convex and equilateral. We begin by decorating each of the triangular facets of a tetrahedron, an octahedron, or an icosahedron with the               T               vertices and connecting edges of a ``Goldberg triangle.'' We obtain the unique set of internal angles in each planar face of each polyhedron by solving a system of               n               equations and               n               variables, where the equations set the dihedral angle discrepancy about different types of edge to zero, and the variables are a subset of the internal angles in 6gons. Like the faces in Kepler's rhombic polyhedra, the 6gon faces in Goldberg polyhedra are equilateral and planar but not equiangular. We show that there is just a single tetrahedral Goldberg polyhedron, a single octahedral one, and a systematic, countable infinity of icosahedral ones, one for each Goldberg triangle. Unlike carbon fullerenes and faceted viruses, the icosahedral Goldberg polyhedra are nearly spherical. The reasoning and techniques presented here will enable discovery of still more classes of convex equilateral polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry.},

Our main theorems provide explicit upper bounds for integral probability metrics and, at improved rates, a recently introduced Wasserstein metric for random graph distributions. The bounds are in terms of a vertex error term based on the Papangelou kernels of the vertex point processes and two edge error terms based on conditional edge probabilities. In addition to providing new tools for spatial random graphs along the way, such as a graph-based Georgii--Nguyen--Zessin formula, we also give applications of our bounds to the percolation graph of large balls in a Boolean model and to discretising a generalised random geometric graph.},

  abstract = {The relationship between colloidal building blocks and their assemblies is an active field of research. As a strategy for targeting novel crystal structures, we examine the use of Voronoi particles, which are hard, space-filling particles in the shape of Voronoi cells of a target structure. Although Voronoi particles stabilize their target structure in the limit of high pressure by construction, the thermodynamic assembly of the same structure at moderate pressure, close to the onset of crystallization, is not guaranteed. Indeed, we find that a more symmetric crystal is often preferred due to additional entropic contributions arising from configurational or occupational degeneracy. We characterize the assembly behavior of the Voronoi particles in terms of the symmetries of the building blocks as well as the symmetries of crystal structures and demonstrate how controlling the degeneracies through a modification of particle shape and field-directed assembly can significantly improve the assembly propensity.},

This study explores the mechanism of rotator-to-crystal phase transitions where orientational order is gained in a translationally ordered phase, using rotator-phase forming truncated cubes as a testbed. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for two selected truncations (s), one for s = 0.527 where the rotator and crystal lattices are dissimilar and one for s = 0.572 where the two phases have identical lattices. These differences set the stage for a qualitative difference in their rotator--crystal transitions, highlighting the effect of lattice distortion on phase transition kinetics. Our simulations reveal that significant lattice deviatoric effects could hinder the rotator-to-crystal transition and favor arrangements of lower packing fraction instead. Indeed, upon compression, it is found that for s = 0.527, the rotator phase does not spontaneously transition into the stable, densely packed crystal due to the high lattice strains involved but instead transitions into a metastable solid phase to be colloquially referred to as ``orientational salt'' for short, which has a similar lattice as the rotator phase and exhibits two distinct particle orientations having substitutional order, alternating regularly throughout the system. This study paves the way for further analysis of diffusionless transformations in nanoparticle systems and how lattice-distortion could influence crystallization kinetics.},

It is observed that the structure of the ordered state is foreshadowed in the disordered state through multiple spontaneously occurring ordered domains. Such domains arise due to the entropic preference for local facet alignment between particles and occur transiently and sparsely throughout the system even in the stable isotropic phase. At pressures (and degrees of supersaturation) where the isotropic phase becomes marginally metastable, a classical nucleation process is never observed; instead, the ordered domains increase in number and size, eventually reaching a critical point where they percolate the entire system and spontaneously consolidate to form the ordered phase. The critical number of particles and the per particle free-energy barrier both decrease with pressure. Using the total number of locally ordered particles as a global order parameter, it is predicted that for large systems the ordering transition would only be spontaneous above a critical pressure. Finally, a test designed to probe the ability of the system to favor a single monodomain solid from initially misaligned-ordered domains, reveals that an active interdomain zone mediates the concerted reorientation of particles.},

In particular, selected shapes that form ordered (plastic) phases with various symmetries (cubic and tetragonal) are chosen to unveil trends in the free-energy barrier heights ({$\Delta$}               G               *'s) associated with disorder to order transitions. The shapes studied in this work have truncation parameter (               s               ) values of 0.58, 0.75, 0.8 and 1. The case of octahedra (               s               = 1.0) is studied to provide a counter-example where the isotropic phase nucleates directly into a (Minkowski) crystal phase rather than a rotator phase. The simulated {$\Delta$}               G               *'s for these systems are compared with those previously reported for hard spheres and truncated cubes with               s               = 0.5 (cuboctahedra, CO) and               s               = 2/3 (truncated octahedra, TO). The comparison shows that, for comparable degrees of supersaturation, all rotator phases nucleate with smaller {$\Delta$}               G               *'s than that of the hard sphere crystal, whereas the octahedral crystal nucleates with a larger {$\Delta$}               G               *. Our analysis of near-critical translationally ordered nuclei of octahedra shows a strong bias towards an orientational alignment which is incompatible with the tendency to form facet-to-facet contacts in the disordered phase, thus creating an additional entropic penalty for crystallization. For rotator phases of octahedra-like particles, we observe that the strength of the localized orientational order correlates inversely with {$\Delta$}               G               *. We also observe that for               s               {$>$} 0.66 shapes and similar to octahedra, configurations with high facet alignment do not favor high orientational order, and thus {$\Delta$}               G               *'s increase with truncation.},

Plastic crystals, which are possible mesophases between the fluid and fully ordered crystal, are translationally ordered but exhibit no long range orientational order.

If               G               and               H               share some but not all nontrivial symmetry elements, then a plastic crystal phase exists with preferred particle orientations that recover the absent symmetry elements of the crystal; we call this phase the discrete plastic crystal phase. If               G               and               H               share no nontrivial symmetry elements, then a plastic crystal phase exists without preferred orientations, which we call an indiscrete plastic crystal.},

The core of this algorithm is the calculation of the three shortest non-coplanar vectors to compose the reduced cell. The reduced cell is converted into the real-space reduced cell and then to the Bravais-lattice unit cell. The symmetry-constrained unit cell is, in turn, converted back into the real-space reduced cell, the reciprocal reduced cell and the reciprocal primitive cell. The               DM               package demonstrates superior numerical stability and can tolerate large uncertainties in the experimentally measured input primitive cell, making it especially suitable for electron diffraction analysis. Additionally, the               DM               package can be used to calculate various crystallographic parameters including Bravais-lattice plane indices, zone-axis indices, tilt angles and the radius of the high-order Laue zone ring, thus facilitating the correct determination of the Niggli cell and the Bravais lattice.},

We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.},

  abstract = {The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature's most ubiquitous phenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the production of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.},

Computational study of colloidal self-assembly is one area that is keenly affected: even after computers generate massive amounts of raw data, performing an exhaustive search to determine what (if any) ordered structures occur in a large parameter space of many simulations can be excruciating. We demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to discover interesting areas of parameter space in colloidal self-assembly. We create numerical fingerprints---inspired by bond orientational order diagrams---of structures found in self-assembly studies and use these descriptors to both find interesting regions in a phase diagram and identify characteristic local environments in simulations in an automated manner for simple and complex crystal structures. Utilizing these methods allows analysis to keep up with the data generation ability of modern high-throughput computing environments. {\copyright} 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers               AIChE J               , 64: 2198--2206, 2018},

  abstract = {Background: Shallow-depth vaginoplasty (SDV), also referred to as vaginoplasty without creation of a vaginal canal, is an understudied alternative to full-depth vaginoplasty (FDV), or vaginoplasty with creation of a vaginal canal. SDV is associated with fewer short- and long-term risks and shorter recovery, and does not require a lifelong commitment to vaginal dilation and douching. Aim: To describe a surgical technique for SDV that creates a dimpled introitus, together with clinical outcomes, decision-making prioritization, and satisfaction data. We hypothesize that SDV patients prioritize comparable appearance and sexual function to FDV over shorter-term risk factors, and experience high satisfaction. Methods: We describe (1) a surgical technique for SDV; (2) the proportion of patients who underwent SDV vs. FDV, with SDV complication rates; and (3) the results of an anonymous, electronic questionnaire administered via Qualtrics that assessed SDV patient demographics, terminology preferences, prioritization of decision-guiding factors for choosing SDV over FDV, and postoperative satisfaction across various domains. Outcomes: A total of 110 patients underwent primary feminizing genital gender-affirming surgery at a single institution between April 2017 and July 2022: 35 (32\%) of 110 underwent SDV and 75 (68\%) underwent FDV. The 35 SDV patients were invited to answer the study questionnaire, of which 29 (83\%) completed it (mean age 51.9 {\textpm} 16.7 years, mean body mass index 27.3 {\textpm} 5.3 kg/m2). Results: All but one survey respondent met one or more of the following characteristics: (1) {$\geq$}40 years of age, (2) exclusively feminine-identifying sexual partners, and/or (3) significant aversion to performing long-term vaginal dilation and douching. Ranking of 8 decision-guiding factors revealed prioritization of long-term over short-term outcomes. Postoperatively, patients reported high satisfaction across all 3 domains. When asked if they had to choose between SDV and FDV over again, 86\% reported that they would choose SDV. While 14\% would choose FDV, all but one reported new interest in receptive vaginal intercourse due to finding masculine-identifying partners post-SDV surgery. A total of 27\% of SDV patients experienced complications that required additional surgeries; 82\% of complications were related to urinary spraying. Clinical Implications: SDV is a lower-risk alternative to FDV and is associated with reduced postoperative maintenance and high postoperative satisfaction. Strengths and Limitations: This study describes the clinical outcomes of the largest documented cohort of patients to undergo SDV to date. Limitations include recall bias due to the retrospective survey and use of nonvalidated questions attributed to the paucity of validated genderaffirming surgery questionnaires. Conclusion: SDV's appeal to a large subset of patients (32\% in this study), low complication rate, high satisfaction, and low decisional regret suggests that this surgical option should be offered to all patients seeking feminizing genital gender-affirming surgery.},

Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.},

  abstract = {We analyze the processes governing the lifetimes of transient metastable polymorphs, within the context of classical nucleation theory.           ,              When a solution is supersaturated with respect to multiple polymorphs, the polymorph with the lowest nucleation barrier will form first. If this is a metastable polymorph, it will persist until the induction of nuclei of a lower free-energy phase, marking the onset of a polymorphic transformation. Induction of a more stable polymorph can occur under two conditions: a.) during steady-state nucleation, or b.) after complete crystal growth of the metastable phase. Using the theory of competing stochastic processes, we derive the rare probability of forming a higher-barrier, more-stable polymorph during steady-state nucleation, and use this to explain variations in crystallization products between repeat experiments, which may underlie the phenomenon of ``Disappearing Polymorphs''. We also derive the induction time of a stable phase from a solution equilibrated with a metastable phase, and show that once the stable phase nucleates, bulk metastable crystals will spontaneously ripen onto nanoscale nuclei or seeds of a more stable phase, thermodynamically driving dissolution--reprecipitation processes. Existing strategies to prolong or shorten the lifetimes of transient metastable phases are reviewed and interpreted within the context of polymorphic induction. The analyses in this work are conducted from classical nucleation and crystal growth theories, suggesting that paradigms shifts to `non-classical' nucleation theories may not be necessary to rationalize multistage crystallization.},

Among the most compelling hypothesized mechanisms underlying glass formation is the development in the fluid phase of local structures that somehow prevent crystallization. Here, we explore that mechanism in the case of hard particle glasses by examining the glass transition in an extended alchemical (here, shape) space; that is, a space where particle shape is treated as a thermodynamic variable. We investigate simple systems of hard polyhedra, with no interactions aside from volume exclusion, and show via Monte Carlo simulation that glass formation in these systems arises from a multiplicity of competing local motifs, each of which is prevalent in---and predictable from---nearby ordered structures in alchemical space.},

The linearized tracking error dynamics and the linearized equations of motion are derived in the Lie algebra. Moreover, given an initial condition, the linearized tracking error dynamics and equations of motion are globally valid and evolve independently of the system trajectory. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, the proposed approach shows faster convergence of rotation and position simultaneously than the state-of-the-art geometric variational MPC based on variational-based linearization. Numerical simulation on tracking control of a fully-actuated 3D rigid body dynamics confirms the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the baselines. Furthermore, the proposed MPC is also verified in pose control and locomotion experiments on a quadrupedal robot MIT Mini Cheetah.},

  abstract = {The simulation of large macromolecular systems has been and remains a challenging problem. There is a general presumption that simulations carried in periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are often the most appropriate to suppress boundary effects. To this end, Ewald summation has been employed to handle long ranged interactions in PBC. There has been a great deal of research targeted at improving the efficiency of Ewald summation, an O ( N 2) algorithm in its traditional tbrmulation, where N is the number of particles in the system. This paper reviews Ewald summation techniques by surveying conventional as well as state of the art efficient methods. Conventional methods, such as tabulation and approximation, are first re-examined along with an (\_9(NV2) method. Fourier-based approaches which have reduced the complexity to (.9(N log(N)) are presented. Multipole expansion techniques, suggested as an alternative to Ewald sums, are reviewed and compared to Fourier methods. The computational efficiency of these new methods facilitates longer, larger and more realistic simulations.},

  abstract = {Even 155 years after their first synthesis, Schiff bases continue to surprise inorganic chemists. Schiff-base ligands have played a major role in the development of modern coordination chemistry because of their relevance to a number of interdisciplinary research fields. The chemistry, properties and applications of transition metal and lanthanoid complexes with Schiff-base ligands are now quite mature. On the contrary, the coordination chemistry of Schiff bases with actinoid (5f-metal) ions is an emerging area, and impressive research discoveries have appeared in the last 10 years or so. The chemistry of actinoid ions continues to attract the intense interest of many inorganic groups around the world. Important scientific challenges are the understanding the basic chemistry associated with handling and recycling of nuclear materials; investigating the redox properties of these elements and the formation of complexes with unusual metal oxidation states; discovering materials for the recovery of trans-\{UVIO2\}2+ from the oceans; elucidating and manipulating actinoid-element multiple bonds; discovering methods to carry out multi-electron reactions; and improving the 5f-metal ions' potential for activation of small molecules. The study of 5f-metal complexes with Schiff-base ligands is a currently ``hot'' topic for a variety of reasons, including issues of synthetic inorganic chemistry, metalosupramolecular chemistry, homogeneous catalysis, separation strategies for nuclear fuel processing and nuclear waste management, bioinorganic and environmental chemistry, materials chemistry and theoretical chemistry. This almost-comprehensive review, covers aspects of synthetic chemistry, reactivity and the properties of dinuclear and oligonuclear actinoid complexes based on Schiff-base ligands. Our work focuses on the significant advances that have occurred since 2000, with special attention on recent developments. The review is divided into eight sections (chapters). After an introductory section describing the organization of the scientific information, Sections 2 and 3 deal with general information about Schiff bases and their coordination chemistry, and the chemistry of actinoids, respectively. Section 4 highlights the relevance of Schiff bases to actinoid chemistry. Sections 5--7 are the ``main menu'' of the scientific meal of this review. The discussion is arranged according the actinoid (only for Np, Th and U are Schiff-base complexes known). Sections 5 and 7 are further arranged into parts according to the oxidation states of Np and U, respectively, because the coordination chemistry of these metals is very much dependent on their oxidation state. In Section 8, some concluding comments are presented and a brief prognosis for the future is attempted.},

However, in very small droplets the probability that a catalytic inclusion is present is so much less that their minimum nucleation frequencies are reproducible and form a consistent set of values.             Interfacial energies, {$\sigma$}, between crystal nuclei and the corresponding liquids have been calculated from nucleation frequencies of small droplets on the basis of the theory of homogeneous nucleation. Energies of interfaces, {$\sigma$}g, one atom thick and containing N atoms were calculated from the {$\sigma$}'s. The ratio of {$\sigma$}g to the gram atomic heat of fusion, {$\Delta$}Hf, was approximately 0.45 for most metals but {$\sim$}0.32 for H2O, Bi, Sb, and Ge.             The effect of relative complexity of crystal structure upon the supercooling behavior of pure metals apparently is a reflection of its effect upon {$\Delta$}Hf.},

In Li, within the investigated interval ofp S 3 GPa, the transition temperature rises with pressure, and the low-temperature phase has a 9R structure. In Na, on the contrary, pressure suppresses the transition, so that it disappears even a t p = 0.1-0.2 GPa but the 9R phase is the low-temperature one too. The shape of acoustic emission signals suggests the presence of pre-transition phenomena and differences in the kinetics of transitions in Li and Na. Calculations performed explain the difference in the influence of pressure on structural stability of Li and Na by the effect of proximity of the Fermi level to peaks in the electronic density of states, which appears under pressure in Li but is absent from Na. The same effects account for a pre-martensitic softening of the shear constant, observed under compression of Li.},

  abstract = {Starting with the early alchemists, a holy grail of science has been to make desired materials by modifying the attributes of basic building blocks. Building blocks that show promise for assembling new complex materials can be synthesized at the nanoscale with attributes that would astonish the ancient alchemists in their versatility. However, this versatility means that making a direct connection between building-block attributes and bulk structure is both necessary for rationally engineering materials and difficult because building block attributes can be altered in many ways. Here we show how to exploit the malleability of the valence of colloidal nanoparticle ``elements'' to directly and quantitatively link building-block attributes to bulk structure through a statistical thermodynamic framework we term ``digital alchemy''. We use this framework to optimize building blocks for a given target structure and to determine which building-block attributes are most important to control for selfassembly, through a set of novel thermodynamic response functions, moduli, and susceptibilities. We thereby establish direct links between the attributes of colloidal building blocks and the bulk structures they form. Moreover, our results give concrete solutions to the more general conceptual challenge of optimizing emergent behaviors in nature and can be applied to other types of matter. As examples, we apply digital alchemy to systems of truncated tetrahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and isotropically interacting spheres that self-assemble diamond, fcc, and icosahedral quasicrystal structures, respectively. Although our focus is on colloidal systems, our methods generalize to any building blocks with adjustable interactions.},

  abstract = {Significance             Many natural systems are structured by the ordering of repeated, distinct shapes. Understanding how this happens is difficult because shape affects structure in two ways. One is how the shape of a cell or nanoparticle, for example, affects its surface, chemical, or other intrinsic properties. The other is an emergent, entropic effect that arises from the geometry of the shape itself, which we term ``shape entropy,'' and is not well understood. In this paper, we determine how shape entropy affects structure. We quantify the mechanism and determine when shape entropy competes with intrinsic shape effects. Our results show that in a wide class of systems, shape affects bulk structure because crowded particles optimize their local packing.           ,                             Entropy drives the phase behavior of colloids ranging from dense suspensions of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants. Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even quasicrystals was demonstrated recently in computer simulations and experiments. The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional entropic forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems. Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding through DEFs. We define DEFs in generic systems and compute them for several hard particle systems. We show they are on the order of a few times the thermal energy (                                                                                               k                       B                                          T                                                                  ) at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par with traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In experimental systems with these other interactions, we provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also contribute to self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction between self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems and we treat, in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes, incorporating the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.},

  abstract = {Endowing materials with physical intelligence holds the key for a progress leap in robotic systems. In spite of the growing success for macroscopic devices, transferring these concepts to the microscale presents several challenges connected to the lack of suitable fabrication and design techniques, and of internal response schemes that connect the materials' properties to the function of an autonomous unit. Here, we realize self-propelling colloidal clusters which behave as simple finite state machines, i.e. systems built to possess a finite number of internal states connected by reversible transitions and associated to distinct functions. We produce these units via capillary assembly combining hard polystyrene colloids with two different types of thermo-responsive microgels. The clusters, actuated by spatially uniform AC electric fields, adapt their shape and dielectric properties, and consequently their propulsion, via reversible temperature-induced transitions controlled by light. The different transition temperatures for the two microgels enable three distinct dynamical states corresponding to three illumination intensity levels. The sequential reconfiguration of the microgels affects the velocity and shape of the active trajectories according to a pathway defined by tailoring the clusters' geometry during assembly. The demonstration of these simple systems indicates an exciting route to build more complex units with broader reconfiguration schemes and multiple responses towards the realization of autonomous systems with physical intelligence at the colloidal scale.},

  abstract = {Significance             Computer simulations of hard, polyhedrally shaped particles predict a great diversity of complex colloidal crystal structures via self-assembly. The structural similarities between colloidal crystals and atomic crystals suggest that they should be describable within analogous, although different, conceptual frameworks. Like the chemical bonds that hold atoms together in crystals, the statistical, emergent forces that hold together hard colloidal particles should be describable using the language of bonding. Whereas atomic crystals can be predicted a priori by solving Schr{\"o}dinger's equation, we present a theory of entropic bonding that permits prediction of colloidal crystals by solving a different eigenvalue equation, facilitated by the use of mathematically constructed shape orbitals analogous to atomic orbitals.           ,              Entropy alone can self-assemble hard nanoparticles into colloidal crystals of remarkable complexity whose structures are the same as atomic and molecular crystals, but with larger lattice spacings. Molecular simulation is a powerful tool used extensively to study the self-assembly of ordered phases from disordered fluid phases of atoms, molecules, or nanoparticles. However, it is not yet possible to predict colloidal crystal structures a priori from particle shape as we can for atomic crystals from electronic valency. Here, we present such a first-principles theory. By calculating and minimizing excluded volume within the framework of statistical mechanics, we describe the directional entropic forces that collectively emerge between hard shapes, in familiar terms used to describe chemical bonds. We validate our theory by demonstrating that it predicts thermodynamically preferred structures for four families of hard polyhedra that match, in every instance, previous simulation results. The success of this first-principles approach to entropic colloidal crystal structure prediction furthers fundamental understanding of both entropically driven crystallization and conceptual pictures of bonding in matter.},

The tetrahedral geometry is ubiquitous in natural and manmade materials, yet regular tetrahedra present a formidable challenge in understanding their self-assembly behavior as they do not tile space. Here, we report diverse supracrystals from gold nanotetrahedra including the quasicrystal (QC) and the dimer packing predicted more than a decade ago and hitherto unknown phases. We solve the complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of the QC by a combination of electron microscopy, tomography, and synchrotron X-ray scattering. Nanotetrahedron vertex sharpness, surface ligands, and assembly conditions work in concert to regulate supracrystal structure. We also discover that the surface curvature of supracrystals can induce structural changes of the QC tiling and eventually, for small supracrystals with high curvature, stabilize a hexagonal approximant. Our findings bridge the gap between computational design and experimental realization of soft matter assemblies and demonstrate the importance of accurate control over nanocrystal attributes and the assembly conditions to realize increasingly complex nanopolyhedron supracrystals.},

We aim to provide a brief account of new developments while highlighting the key experimental parameters that give rise to icosahedral nanocrystals. We focus on monometallic systems based on Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Rh, along with some bimetallic systems.

At the same time, advances in computing allow for sophisticated simulation models that aid in the understanding and exploration of these systems. However, both experimental and computational analysis of complex crystals at the atomic, molecular and colloidal scales face a common challenge: the lack of generalizable tools for structure, strain, and dislocation analysis. Generalizable methods such as Fourier filtering often rely on manual inspection of structural data, making them impractical for systematic, large-scale studies. Although domain specific tools for automated analysis of 2D electron diffraction patterns exist, these tools are not generalizable to arbitrary 2D and 3D datasets. Here, we present a structure agonistic software tool for semi-automated analysis of 2D and 3D particle data. Our algorithm is robust to noise originating from liquid, polycrystalline or otherwise disordered regions, and can be used to analyze strain in atomic, molecular and colloidal crystals of varying complexity and from disparate data collection sources. This method holds promise for advancing structural studies across a variety of domains by providing researchers with a powerful, generalizable tool for understanding and exploring complex crystal structures.}

Our mechanistic studies indicate that the cuboctahedral seeds were directed to grow into octahedrons, truncated tetrahedrons, and then tetrahedrons when Pd(acac)2 was used as a precursor. In contrast, the same batch of seeds only evolved into octahedrons with increasing sizes when the precursor was switched to Na2PdCl4. The difference in growth pattern could be attributed to the different reduction rates of these two precursors. The fast reduction of Pd(acac)2 led to a quick drop in concentration for the precursor in the very early stage of a synthesis, forcing the growth into a kinetically controlled mode. In comparison, the slow reduction of Na2PdCl4 could maintain this precursor at a relatively high concentration to ensure thermodynamically controlled growth. This work not only advances our understanding of the growth mechanism of tetrahedrons but also offers a new approach to controlling the shape of metal nanocrystals.},

  abstract = {Surface heterogeneity of colloidal particles has a significant impact on their structure in solution and their rheological properties.           ,              Surface heterogeneity of colloidal particles has a significant impact on their structure in solution and their rheological properties. During particle synthesis, heterogeneous chemical functionalization, processes of self-assembly, or phase separation, can all lead to heterogeneous colloidal surfaces which impart anisotropic interactions to suspended particles. Additionally, an important class of colloids, biological macromolecules, exhibit similar localized, short-ranged, anisotropic interactions, which have a significant impact on their solution properties. Therefore, understanding the assembly and rheology of such colloids can provide insight into a wide variety of relevant physical systems. In this computational study, we investigate dispersions of particles having surface patches with randomized functionality as a model for heterogeneous colloids. We use Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions to explore the differences between these random patchy particles and homogeneous (or isotropic) particles. The common basis used for comparing dispersions of particles with different surface functionality is equality of the second virial coefficient, so that dispersions of particles with different patterns of surface heterogeneity are similar thermodynamically at low particle concentrations. We show that at modest particle concentrations, significant deviations from the isotropic model are evident in the dispersion micro-structure, giving drastically different percolation transition points depending on the degree of surface heterogeneity. However, these deviations can be rationalized and a universal percolation criteria derived in terms of the osmotic pressure of the dispersion. Heterogeneous interactions also impose extra constraints on the relative translation and rotation between neighboring particles, which increase the viscosity and elastic modulus of aggregated dispersions and gels built from heterogeneous colloids and shifts the gel point measurably.},

  abstract = {Extensive work has demonstrated that equivariant neural networks can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization by enforcing an inductive bias in the network architecture. These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems.},

B22 of hen egg-white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin was measured by static light scattering under the variation of pH, temperature, and crystallization agents. Comparing B22 values and precipitate morphology in a systematically analyzed range of solution conditions allows the construction of the so-called crystallization slot. The thermodynamic driving force for crystallization is supersaturation, which is set by the protein concentration and the solubility (related to B22). Hence, besides the optimal B22 range, the protein concentration and, if solubilities are available, the supersaturation leads to a two-dimensional crystallization window where crystal formation is possible. This is shown in a generalized state diagram, where protein morphologies are solely determined as a function of protein concentration or supersaturation and interactions.},

  abstract = {The second virial coefficient, A2, is evaluated between pairs of short chain molecules by direct simulations using a parallel tempering Monte Carlo method where the centers of mass of the two molecules are coupled by a harmonic spring. Three off-lattice polymer models are considered, one with rigid bonds and two with flexible bonds, represented by the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential with different stiffness. All the models considered account for excluded volume interactions via the Lennard-Jones potential. In order to obtain the second virial coefficient we calculate the effective intermolecular interaction between the two polymer chains. As expected this intermolecular interaction is found to be strongly dependent upon chain length and temperature. For all three models the {\texttheta} temperature ({\texttheta}n), defined as the temperature at which the second virial coefficient vanishes for chains of finite length, varies as {\texttheta}n-{\texttheta}{$\infty\propto$}n-1/2, where n is the number of bonds in the polymer chains and {\texttheta}{$\infty$} is the {\texttheta} point for an infinitely long chain. Introducing flexibility into the model has two effects upon {\texttheta}n; the {\texttheta} temperature is reduced with increasing flexibility, and the n dependence of {\texttheta}n is suppressed. For a particular choice of spring constant an n-independent {\texttheta} temperature is found. We also compare our results with those obtained from experimental studies of polystyrene in decalin and cyclohexane, and for poly(methyl methacrylate) in a water and tert-butyl alcohol mixture, and show that all the data can be collapsed onto a single universal curve without any adjustable parameters. We are thus able to relate both A2 and the excluded volume parameter v, to the chain interaction parameter z, in a way relating not only the data for different molecular weights and temperatures, but also for different polymers in different solvents.},

Here, we present a computational study of controlling self-propelled colloidal particle propulsion speeds to cooperatively capture and transport cargo particles, which otherwise produce random dispersions. By sensing swarm and cargo coordinates, each particle's speed is actuated according to a control policy based on multiagent assignment and path planning strategies that navigate stochastic particle trajectories to targets around cargo. Colloidal swarms are shown to dynamically cage cargo at their center via inward radial forces while simultaneously translating via directional forces. Speed, power, and efficiency of swarm tasks display emergent coupled dependences on swarm size and pair interactions and approach asymptotic limits indicating near-optimal performance. This scheme exploits unique interactions and stochastic dynamics in colloidal swarms to capture and transport microscopic cargo in a robust, stable, error-tolerant, and dynamic manner.},

  abstract = {ZnO hexagonal pyramids were obtained in hydrophilic media without any traditional stabilizers (capping agents). The absence of a thick organic shell reducing the anisotropy of nanoparticle (NP) interactions, oxide nature of the materials, and new geometry of the nanocrystals makes possible the observation of new self-organization phenomena. Several new features not present in the previous cases of NP self-organization were identified and discussed. The formation of ZnO pyramids involved recrystallization of larger amorphous NPs followed by the multistage disassembly of intermediate aggregates into individual virtually perfectly shaped nanocrystals. The evolution of NPs begins with crystallization of clustered plates within the original amorphous spherical colloids, and then agglomerated truncated pyramids are formed. These agglomerates further transform into chained pyramids, which eventually separate from each other. The crystallization and disassembly processes can be associated with the decrease of potential and anisotropy of the attractive force field around the crystallites represented in part by dipole moments. The reassembly of the pyramids can still be attained via engaging excluded volume interaction after adding similarly charged polymer. Overall, in this system, we see the first examples of (1) coupled crystallization and disassembly process; (2) induced assembly of nanoscale particles using excluded volume interactions, which were previously used only for aggregation of microscale colloids; and (3) nanoparticle assemblies with variable and experimentally verifiable relative orientation of dipoles including head-to-tail, tail-to-tail pairs, and antiparallel chains. Described assemblies of ZnO pyramids with collective behavior of individual building blocks as well as distinct and experimentally controlled stages of assembly and disassembly present a fundamentally interesting nanoparticle system with rich dynamic behavior.},

However, their practical applications are limited by the lack of effective folding schemes with minimum degrees of freedom. Here in the paper we created a transformation between a tetrahedron and a truncated tetrahedron with one degree of freedom by properly setting a movable joint at each vertex. Two schemes of joint arrangement were proposed, and their kinematic behaviours were respectively studied analytically and numerically, where mobility calculations are both based on the truss transformation. Finally, the transformation process using the first scheme was demonstrated through a cardboard prototype fabricated with the origami technique.},

  abstract = {Lattice structure has become an important energy absorber with its light weight and high strength ratio. In this paper, the stable flat-topped pyramid is used as the structural cell, and square frustum lattice structure (SFLS) with excellent energy absorption performance is designed. The geometry of SFLS is controlled by three factors: cell height, side length ratio and cell number. The quasi-static compression experiment and the finite element (FE) simulation were used to analyse the energy absorption characteristics of SFLS. The results show that the deformation of SFLSs is tightened folding mode, and produce a quasi-rectangular energy absorption curve. The parameterization study found that the better energy absorption performance is the SFLS with arbitrary cell number value, small cell height value and side length ratio close to 1, and the maximum SEA value can reach 72.05 J/g. Finally, by modifying the theoretical prediction model of mean crushing force and comparing with the FE results, it is found that the introduced correction coefficient can reduce the absolute error value from 32.18\% to 4.96\%, which indicates that the modified theoretical prediction model can be accurately used for prediction.},

Both groups rely upon certain assumptions, with most considering only aggregate scores on clinical instruments. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines elements from both discrete and continuous mood models, using a machine learning pipeline to detect subtle patterns across individuals. Latent factors are constructed from assessments at the item level, then clustered into groups referred to as microstates. Transitions between microstates are captured via a discrete-time Markov chain, allowing for characterization of mood's dynamic nature. Key findings include a factor mapping heavily onto irritability and aggression, as well as a hierarchical pattern of microstates within depression and mania. Validity of these results is confirmed by reproduction in an unseen data set from a separate subject cohort.},

Using the Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much of any symmetry exists in a nonsymmetric configuration; what is the nearest symmetry group of any given configuration; and how the symmetrized shapes, with respect to any symmetry group, look. The CSM approach is first presented in a practical easy-to-implement set of rules, which are later proven in a rigorous mathematical layout. Most of our examples concentrate on tetrahedral structures because of their key importance in chemistry. Thus, we show how to evaluate the amount of tetrahedricity (Tf) existing in nonsymmetric tetrahedra; the amount of other symmetries they contain; and the continuous symmetry changes in fluctuating, vibrating, and rotating tetrahedra. The tool we developed bears on any physical or chemical process and property which is either governed by symmetry considerations or which is describable in terms of changes in symmetry.},

  abstract = {The distance of closest approach of hard particles is a key parameter of their interaction and plays an important role in the resulting phase behavior. For non-spherical particles, the distance of closest approach depends on orientation, and its calculation is surprisingly difficult. Although overlap criteria have been developed for use in computer simulations [1, 2], no analytic solutions have been obtained for the distance of closest approach of ellipsoids in 3-D, or, until now, for ellipses in 2-D. We have derived an analytic expression for the distance of closest approach of the centers of two arbitrary hard ellipses as function of their orientation relative to the line joining their centers. We describe our method for solving this problem, illustrate our result, and discuss its usefulness in modeling and simulating systems of anisometric particles such as liquid crystals.},

  abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics (MD) implementation of an extended statistical mechanical ensemble that includes `alchemical' degrees of freedom describing particle attributes as thermodynamic variables. We demonstrate the use of this alchemical MD method in inverse design simulations of particles interacting via the Oscillating Pair Potential (OPP) and the Lennard--Jones--Gauss potential (LJG) -- two general, previously studied models for which phase diagrams are known. We show that alchemical MD can quickly and efficiently optimise pair potentials for target structures within a specified design space in the low-temperature regime, where internal energy adequately represents the features of the alchemical free energy landscape. We show that alchemical MD can be also used to inversely design pair potentials to achieve target materials properties (here, bulk modulus) directly, without explicit knowledge of the structure--property relationship. Alchemical MD can easily be generalised and applied to any target materials properties or structures and used with any differentiable interaction potential.},

  abstract = {Advances in synthesizing colloidal nanoparticles with tailored interactions through surface modifications provide vast possibilities to create new materials through self-assembly. Alongside experimental advances, computational methods are contributing to rational materials-by-design by inversely optimizing building blocks capable of self-assembling into target structures. Radially symmetric (isotropic) pair potentials are commonly used to model interacting particles in such a design process. In this work, we apply an inverse design approach called `digital alchemy' to a generalized Fourier potential (FP) to search a broad design space of isotropic pair interactions targeting 23 crystal structures spanning a range of complexities. Digital alchemy (DA) is a method for optimizing nanoparticle attributes (such as interaction strength and range, and even particle shape) for a target structure in a generalized thermodynamic framework where the attributes are treated as fluctuating thermodynamic variables in situ. Using DA, we find six optimized isotropic interaction potentials that produce six corresponding targeted crystal structures via self-assembly. Importantly, these six are those cases where the optimized potential for the target structure and the ground state structure at zero temperature for the corresponding potential coincide. In these cases, the optimized pair potential is the ``best'' potential for the crystal structure and the crystal structure is, conversely, the ``best'' structure for the pair potential. For other cases, we show that although most of the optimized isotropic pair potentials stabilize their corresponding target structures, the structures do not self-assemble when the target structure has structurally similar polymorphs. In such cases, we obtain a family of nearly identical optimized potentials for the set of similar structures, and only one of them---the structure that minimizes the energy (i.e. is ``best'') for the obtained potential---can be successfully self-assembled. We discuss and provide insight into these limitations inherent in using isotropic pair potentials for inverse design.},

Yet, the structural holy grail in photonic materials, diamond, remains challenging to synthesize at the colloidal length scale. Here we explore new ways to assemble diamond using modified gyrobifastigial (mGBF) nanoparticles, a shape that resembles two anti-aligned triangular prisms. We investigate the parameter space that leads to the self-assembly of diamond, and we compare the likelihood of defects in diamond self-assembled               via               mGBF               vs.               the nanoparticle shape that is the current focus for assembling diamond, the truncated tetrahedra. We introduce a potential route for realizing mGBF particles by dimerizing triangular prisms using attractive patches, and we report the impact of this superstructure on the photonic properties.},
